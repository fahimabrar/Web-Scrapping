Speaker 1: (00:10)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the President and First Lady of the United States, Donald J. Trump and Melania Trump. (silence).
Donald Trump: (01:33)
Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you.
Crowd: (01:45)
We love you. We love you.
Donald Trump: (01:45)
Thank you very much, and we love you. And I can tell you that from the bottom of my heart, this has been an incredible four years. We’ve accomplished so much together. I want to thank all of my family, and my friends, and my staff, and so many other people for being here. I want to thank you for your effort, your hard work. People have no idea how hard this family worked. They worked. And they worked for you. They could have had a much easier life, but they just did a fantastic job, I just want to thank all of you, everyone. I want to thank Mark Meadows, who’s here someplace right there. I want to thank Mark., But it’s been been something very special. We’ve accomplished a lot. Our First Lady has been a woman of great grace and beauty and dignity.
Crowd: (02:36)
Thank you, Melania.
Donald Trump: (02:40)
And so popular with the people. So popular with the people. In fact, honey, would you like to say a few words?
Melania Trump: (02:50)
Being your first lady was my greatest honor. Thank you for your love and your support. You will be in my thoughts and prayers. God bless you all, God bless your families, and God bless this beautiful nation.
Donald Trump: (03:12)
What else has to be said, right? But what we’ve done… That’s true, honey. Great job. What we’ve done has been amazing by any standard. We rebuilt the United States military. We created a new force called Space Force. That in itself would be a major achievement for a regular administration. We were not a regular administration. We took care of the vets, 91% approval rating. They’ve never had that before. The vets have given us, the VA, the vets have given us an approval rating like has never been before. We took care of our vets, and our beautiful vets. They were very badly treated before we came along. And as you know, we get them great service and we pick up the bill, and they can go out and they can see a doctor if they have to wait long periods of time. We got it so that we can sadly get rid of people that don’t treat our vets properly. We didn’t have any of those rights before when I came on. So our vets are happy. Our people are happy. Our military is thrilled.
Donald Trump: (04:25)
We also got tax cuts, the largest tax cut and reform in the history of our country by far. I hope they don’t raise your taxes, but if they do, I told you so. And if you look at the regulations, which I consider the regulation cuts to be maybe even more important, that’s why we have such good and have had such good job numbers. And job numbers have been absolutely incredible. When we started, had we not been hit by the pandemic, we would have had numbers that would never have been seen. Already, our numbers are the best ever. If you look at what happened until February a year ago, our numbers were at a level that nobody had ever seen before. And even now, we really built it twice. We got hit. Nobody blames us for that. The whole world got hit, and then we built it again. And now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its higher point prior to the pandemic. So it’s a really, you could say we built it twice. And you’re going to see incredible numbers start coming in, if everything is sort of left alone. Be careful, very complex, be careful, but you’re going to see some incredible things happening.
Donald Trump: (05:48)
And remember us when you see these things happening, if you would. Remember us because I’m looking at elements of our economy that are set to be a rocket ship up. It’s a rocket ship up. We have the greatest country in the world. We have the greatest economy in the world. And as bad as the pandemic was, we were hit so hard just like the entire world was hit so hard. Places that thought they got away with it, didn’t get away with it. They’re suffering right now.
Donald Trump: (06:22)
We did something that is a really considered a medical miracle. They’re calling it a miracle. And that was the vaccine. We got the vaccine developed in nine months instead of nine years, or five years, or 10 years, or a long time. It was supposed to take a long time, many, many years to develop a vaccine. We have two out, we have another one coming almost immediately, and it really is a great achievement. So you should start to see really good numbers over the next few months. I think you’re going to see those numbers really skyrocket downward. And I can only say this. We have worked hard. We’ve left it all, as the athletes would say, we’ve left it all on the field. We don’t have to come and say… We’ll never say in a month, when we’re sitting in Florida, we’re not going to be looking at each other and saying, “You know, if we only worked a little bit harder.” You can’t work harder.
Donald Trump: (07:24)
And we had a lot of obstacles, and we went through the obstacles and we just got 75 million votes. And that’s a record in the history of sitting presidents. That’s an all time record by a lot, by many millions, in the history of sitting presidents. It’s been really just an honor. And one of the things we’re very, very proud of is the selection of almost 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. That’s a very big number. That’s a record setting number. And so we’ve done a lot, and there’s still things to do.
Donald Trump: (08:06)
The first thing we have to do is pay our respects and our love to the incredible people and families who’ve suffered so gravely from the China Virus. It’s a horrible thing that was put onto the world. We all know where it came from, but it’s a horrible, horrible thing. So be very careful, be very, very careful. But we want to pay a great love, great love to all of the people that have suffered, including families who have suffered so gravely. So with that, I just want to say you are amazing people. This is a great, great country. It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president.
Crowd: (08:58)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump. Thank you, Trump.
Donald Trump: (09:27)
I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again, we put it in a position like it’s never been before, despite the worst plague to hit, since I guess you’d say 1917, over a hundred years ago. And despite that, despite that, the things that we’ve done have been just incredible and I couldn’t have done it without you. So just a goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form.
Donald Trump: (10:31)
And again, I want to just in leaving, I want to thank our Vice President, Mike Pence, and Karen. I want to thank Congress, because we really worked well with Congress, at least certain elements of Congress. But we really did. We’ve gotten so much done that nobody thought would be possible, but I do want to thank Congress. And I want to thank all of the great people of Washington, DC. All of the people that we worked with to put this miracle together. So have a good life. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

President Donald Trump: (00:00)
My fellow Americans, four years ago we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do, and so much more. This week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word.
President Donald Trump: (00:55)
I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter, Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Baron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife, Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the dedicated members of the White House staff, and the cabinet, and all of the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America.
President Donald Trump: (01:48)
I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people, the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House military office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the armed forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is, a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation.
President Donald Trump: (02:50)
All Americans were horrified by the assault on our capital. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for president because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena, nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done.
President Donald Trump: (03:51)
America had given me so much and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking Patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about America first because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left. It wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before.
President Donald Trump: (04:51)
We fix our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal. And we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China, made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus.
President Donald Trump: (05:31)
Our trade relationship was rapidly changing. Billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the US but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, almost everyone. Income soared, wages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle.
President Donald Trump: (06:42)
The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during the short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the USA. To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow.
President Donald Trump: (07:40)
When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done, but we did it. They called it a medical miracle. And that’s what they’re calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken three, four, five, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months. We grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all.
President Donald Trump: (08:20)
When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform.
President Donald Trump: (09:07)
We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say, we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in US history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.
President Donald Trump: (10:05)
We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us.
President Donald Trump: (10:43)
And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military, all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years.
President Donald Trump: (11:13)
We revitalize our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader al-Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher, Qassem Soleimani. We recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars.
President Donald Trump: (12:13)
Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that in America the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests corporations or global entities, it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As president my top priority, my constant concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy.
President Donald Trump: (13:16)
Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have the government listen. You are loyal to your country and my administration was always loyal to you.
President Donald Trump: (13:54)
We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible.
President Donald Trump: (14:26)
Now, as I leave the white house, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality.
President Donald Trump: (15:12)
What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common, the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.
President Donald Trump: (16:13)
In America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space.
President Donald Trump: (17:08)
As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me. They came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction, that America is the greatest nation in all of history.
President Donald Trump: (17:48)
We are and must always be a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw, from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly, and from the forbidden city in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you. I fought for your family. I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for, and that is safe, strong, proud, and free.
President Donald Trump: (18:39)
Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle, but instead, only grows stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts, deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation can not achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong and our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

Donald Trump: (00:00)
My fellow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of our Republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want to be very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement.
Donald Trump: (00:35)
Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions and values. Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We can not tolerate it.
Donald Trump: (01:26)
Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, no exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.
Donald Trump: (02:12)
Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here in Washington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on the potential threats. Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind.
Donald Trump: (03:02)
Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington, D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm, moderation and grace. We will get through this challenge just like we always do.
Donald Trump: (03:51)
I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.
Donald Trump: (04:49)
Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.

Donald Trump: (03:51)
Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Great honor to be here. We’ve worked long and hard. Please sit down. We’ve worked long and hard to get this done. They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I’m honored to be here in the Rio Grand Valley with the courageous men and women of customs and border patrol. These people are incredible. They’re really incredible. I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years. Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall. We got it exactly as you wanted it, everything including your protective plate on top.
Donald Trump: (04:32)
I say, “Why did we put that?” And they said, “We need it for extra protection, climb plate,” and we have everything you want. It’s steel, it’s concrete inside the steel, and then it’s rebar, a lot of heavy rebar in side the concrete, and it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have, but we gave you a 100% of what you wanted, so now you have no excuses. I didn’t want you to have any excuses. You set records, and we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that. I don’t think that will happen. I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody’s going to be touching it, and you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
We’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement, the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the Southern border. Before we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for. The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.
Donald Trump: (06:06)
And now, I’d like to briefly address the events of last week. Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government. As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic, horrible, horrible, invisible enemy, and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought even remotely possible … Nobody thought it was going to be possible. They said it would take five years. “Sir, it will take seven years.” All of our scientists were saying, our advisers, “It will seven years, five years, 10 years, maybe.” Well, we did it just like I said we would, and we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible, and we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas.
Donald Trump: (07:17)
Florida’s doing great. Some of them are doing great. Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle, and we get it to them as fast as they need it and even faster. But they’re calling it a medical miracle, and this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election. The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm. Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement, so many are here, is the foundation of the MAGA agenda, and we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order. That is why we’re …
Donald Trump: (08:03)
… law and we’re a nation of order. That is why we’re here today to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are. Do you feel like a hero? Yeah, I think you do. Right? You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner, Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible. Where’s Mark? Mark, stand up, Mark. Great job. Fantastic. Chief Patrol Agent, Brian Hastings. Brian, thank you very much. Great job. He’s so happy. He said, “Sir, this really works.” And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country.
Donald Trump: (08:52)
I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, friend of mine, Tom Homan. He’s a great American patriot and he was with us right from the beginning. Right, Tom? You knew exactly … He said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no. We need drones, we need drones.” I said, “Why? So you could watch the people pour into our country illegally?” And I want to thank you very much, Tom. What a professional job you’ve done. All of you people, incredible.
Donald Trump: (09:18)
Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story. This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border. Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall. We reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in US history. It is at a level that it’s never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes and the special interests and we restored the rule of law.
Donald Trump: (09:55)
For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite. They even promised a wall, if you remember. About 10 years ago, they promised a wall, but they couldn’t get it built. It wasn’t easy getting it built. Getting it financed was tough. Getting it built was even tougher. All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through, very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done, but they had it …
Donald Trump: (10:26)
Years ago, you remember that better than anybody, right? And they never got it done. They never, ever completed the task. And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government, spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. And today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone, the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall, 450 miles. Nobody realizes how big that is.
Donald Trump: (10:59)
I remember when I first came down about a year and a half ago, we’re under construction and I started walking. And I’m looking at the wall and I’m walking and walking. And I’m used to a development project where you could walk a wall; 10 acres, five acres, two acres, one acre. And I realized that’s a long time. That’s a big walk. A lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural. You have the mountains, you have the rives, you have some very powerful water areas, you have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by. So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them … because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles. And that’s currently under construction. This was our original wish, to get these areas done where there was such trouble. And now, we have it. It’s either in construction or in pre-construction, an additional 300 miles.
Donald Trump: (11:57)
In every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted, absolutely plummeted. In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80%. In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90%. Nationwide, ICE and border patrol have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroine, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records, some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS13, probably the worst gang of them all.
Donald Trump: (12:49)
Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty. Our most important reform was ending catch and release. Not easy to do. You’re dealing with Congress. It’s very, very difficult, which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse. It’s catch and release them. It means release into our country, not into another country. This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere.
Donald Trump: (13:29)
Now, instead of catch and release, we have detain and remove. It’s called detain and remove. Doesn’t that sound better? One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud. Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country, the most ridiculous thing anyone’s ever seen. And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud and that’s what we did.
Donald Trump: (14:03)
This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols or MPP. Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard. They used to wait here. And when they were waiting, they would say, “Bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country. And essentially, we’d never find them again. We’d never see them again. This one measure, alone, ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives and especially, I have to say, lives from crime.
Donald Trump: (14:39)
I want to thank the great President of Mexico. He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine, President Obrador. He is a man who really knows what’s happening and he loves his country and he also loves the United States, but I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship. We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years. Nobody thought that was possible. And they made it very, very difficult and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall.
Donald Trump: (15:18)
And by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working now. They can be working on other things, other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on because we saved massive numbers of people. And included here, we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world. We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle. That’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when …
Donald Trump: (16:03)
… Immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a US community. Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them. They would say, “No, no, no.” I said, “Well, you got to take them.” First month, I’ll never forget these gentlemen right here came to me. They said, “They won’t take them back.” They came, they may be murderers, they may be cartel heads, they may be some really vicious people. The countries didn’t want them back. And I stopped all payments to those countries. I stopped everything going to those countries. And after it was stopped for about a month, you remember? After it was stopped for about a month, they called, they said, “We’d love to have them back.” And I never gave him as much money as they were getting by the way, but they got some.
Donald Trump: (16:56)
It was amazing. And you people know better than anyone, they wouldn’t take them back. Would have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here. And then say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.” And they’d take them by boat and they’d take them by bus and they wouldn’t let them into their countries. And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back. We love having you.” So it was a great thing and now they do take them back. And the relationship with those countries, the triangle, the relationship is a much better one than it was before. In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose, not a free ticket for entry. A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be.
Donald Trump: (17:51)
It would be a disaster for our country. I know they’re thinking about removing them. I hope they don’t do that. I hope they don’t do that. It’ll be an absolute travesty for our country. The report conclusively proves once and for all that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home. They won’t go home. And you rarely find them. It’s very tough to find them. So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals, and we’ve stopped that. Don’t ever start that process again. By contrast, under our policies, 98% of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed. Simply put, if you entered the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately, safely removed from our country. Without this core principle, there is no border. There is no law. There is no water. My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border in response to the China virus under Title 42 of the US code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants in local communities, and the public at large.
Donald Trump: (19:13)
Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions. As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID has got about 24 names. I can call it from COVID to China virus. I can call it the plague, I call it the China plague, a lot of different names. But we always call it the invisible enemy. But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape, because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape. But on the other side in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus. It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved, and we didn’t do the wall because of COVID. We did the wall because of security and drugs and other things, but it turned out that in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague.
Donald Trump: (20:12)
We inherited a dangerously lawless border. The people that work here are unbelievably brave. I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through. They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans. We fixed it and we secured it. We empowered our wonderful ICE and border patrol to fulfill their oaths and they became sworn officers of the law and they love their job. It’s a tough job. It’s a nasty job. They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up. We got you up. But these are incredibly talented people. They could probably do a lot better in terms of economics than they do here, but they love what they do and they love their country. We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system.
Donald Trump: (21:09)
Where they’d come up, go in our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job. We also have, and we had, but we have them all the time, we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border. That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the Southern border than it was through airports or any other means. So they’d land in South America and they’d work their way up and they’d come into our country. And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect. These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East. And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand, really far greater. Removing any of these would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year. No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are.
Donald Trump: (22:15)
In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration, a wave like you’ve never seen before. And I can tell you that already waves are starting to come up from 2000 and 1000 and 500 miles away. We see what’s coming, and they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end. It’s going to be a gravy train. Change the name from the caravans, which I think we came up with, to the gravy train, because that’s what they’re looking for. Looking for the gravy. This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health. It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives. The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and border patrol.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall. We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me. To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard, those from DHS. At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed. They’re literally waiting, big, big groups of people. Some of them very unsavory, I might add. This is an entirely preventable tragedy, it’s waiting to happen. The safety of our nation must come before politics, we have many disagreements in the country. But we should all agree, the-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
… many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference. ICE and border patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointees should ever order them to violate that oath. These are real experts. They really get it. And I’ll tell you who else gets it. The Hispanic population of our country gets it because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic. And people were amazed to see that. And the numbers, they say, were, Governor of Texas called, great guy, great governor, called. He said, “You had numbers that nobody’s had since reconstruction.” Reconstruction means Civil War. And a largely Hispanic. They understand it better than anybody. And they want law enforcement to help them, help them live safe lives.
Donald Trump: (25:09)
The laws that Congress passed must be upheld. To the men and women of ICE, customs, and border protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you. I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true. I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future. God bless you, God bless law enforcement, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great job.

We’re going to Texas. We’re going to the Southern border. As you know, we completed the wall. They may want to expand it. We have the expansion underway. It’s been tremendously successful far beyond what anyone thought. We’re stopping in large numbers the drugs coming into the country for many, many years and decades. We’re stopping a lot of illegal immigration. Our numbers have been very good. There does seem to be a surge now because people are coming up. So caravans are starting to form because they think there’s going to be a lot in it for them, if they’re able to get through, but we’re able to stop it.
Donald Trump: (00:43)
The wall has made a tremendous difference. I think some of you are coming with me, but the wall has made a tremendous difference on the Southern border. As far as this is concerned, we want no violence, never violence. We want absolutely no violence. And on the impeachment, it’s really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics. It’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous. This impeachment is causing tremendous anger as you’re doing it. And it’s really a terrible thing that they’re doing. For Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country and it’s causing tremendous anger. I want no violence. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.

I think that big tech is doing a horrible thing for our country, and to our country. And I believe it is going to be a catastrophic mistake for them. They’re dividing and divisive and they’re showing something that I’ve been predicting for a long time. I’ve been predicting it for a long time and people didn’t act on it. But I think big tech has made a terrible mistake and very, very bad for our country. And that’s leading others to do the same thing. And it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger, a big mistake. They shouldn’t be doing it, but there’s always a countermove when they do that. I’ve never seen such anger as I see right now, and that’s a terrible thing, terrible thing. And you have to always avoid violence. And we have tremendous support. We have support probably like nobody’s ever seen before. Always have to avoid violence.
Speaker 2: (02:56)
What is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility?
Donald Trump: (03:01)
So if you read my speech and many people have done it and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media on television, it’s been analyzed and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate. And if you look at what other people have said, politicians at a high level, about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places. That was a real problem, what they said, but they’ve analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence. And everybody to the T thought it was totally appropriate. Okay, thank you.

Donald Trump: (00:00)
I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always be a nation of law and order.
Donald Trump: (00:25)
The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. We have just been through an intense election and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America.
Donald Trump: (00:55)
My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections.
Donald Trump: (01:25)
Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.
Donald Trump: (01:38)
This moment calls for healing and reconciliation. 2020 has been a challenging time for our people. A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy, and claimed countless lives. Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family.
Donald Trump: (02:20)
To the citizens of our country, serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning.

The media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here, but you don’t see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don’t want to show that. We have hundreds of thousands of people here, and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what’s really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They’re not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country. I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I’ve never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I’m concerned, single biggest problem, the fake news and the big tech. Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year, they rigged an election. They rigged it like they’ve never rigged an election before. By the way, last night, they didn’t do a bad job either, if you notice. I’m honest. I just, again, I want to thank you. It’s just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you. Hundreds of thousands of American patriots are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious Republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they’re doing and stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up. We will never concede, it doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.
Donald Trump: (04:42)
Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that’s what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election, and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election. I say sometimes jokingly, but there’s no joke about it, I’ve been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago. I was told by the real pollsters, we do have real pollsters. They know that we were going to do well, and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn’t go to 66. We went to 75 million and they say we lost. We didn’t lose.
Donald Trump: (06:08)
By the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You could take third world countries. Just take a look, take third world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we’ve been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. Even when you look at last night, they’re all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen. Not going to let it happen.

You’re doing a great job, but I’d love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let them come up, please? Rudy, you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican party. He’s got guts, he fights. He fights, and I’ll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That’s a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, ” What an absolute disgrace, that this could be happening to our constitution.” He looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing.
Donald Trump: (08:09)
I hope so. I hope so because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do. This is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We’re supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our constitution, and protect our constitution. States want to revote. The States got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice-President Pence has to do is send it back to the States to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.
Donald Trump: (09:08)
I just spoke to Mike. I said, “Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage,” and then we’re stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen. Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That’s what it is.

No, but you look at that behind. I wish they’d flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing, amazing, all the way back. Don’t worry. We will not take the name off the Washington monument. We will not. Cancel culture. They wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial, either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don’t think that’s going to happen. It damn well better not. Although with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You’ll see some really bad things happen.
Donald Trump: (10:54)
They’ll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They’ve been taking his statue down, but then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years and everything stopped. Did you notice that? It stopped. It all stopped. They could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy, they could use you. Your city is going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We’ll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that okay, Rudy?
Donald Trump: (11:25)
We’re gathered together in the heart of our nation’s Capitol for one very, very basic and simple reason, to save our democracy. Most candidates on election evening, and of course this thing goes on so long, they still don’t have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They’ve totally lost control. They’ve used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election. But when you see this and when you see what’s happening, number one, they all say, “Sir, we’ll never let it happen again.” I said, “That’s good, but what about eight weeks ago?” They try and get you to go. They say, “Sir, in four years, you’re guaranteed.” I said, “I’m not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let’s go back eight week.” We want to go back, and we want to get this right because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed, and we’re not going to stand for that.

I could name 24 of them, let’s say. I won’t bore you with it, and then all of a sudden you have something like this. It’s like, “Gee, maybe I’ll talk to the president sometime later.” No, it’s amazing. The weak Republicans, they’re pathetic Republicans and that’s what happens. If this happened to the Democrats, there’d be hell all over the country going on. There’d be hell all over the country. But just remember this. You’re stronger, you’re smarter. You’ve got more going than anybody, and they try and demean everybody having to do with us, and you’re the real people. You’re the people that built this nation. You’re not the people that tore down our nation.
Donald Trump: (13:45)
The weak Republicans, and that’s it. I really believe it. I think I’m going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You got a lot of them, and you got a lot of great ones, but you got a lot of weak ones. They’ve turned a blind eye even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last. Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said, “I want to get rid of the America first policy.” What’s that all about, get rid of …? How do you say, “I want to get rid of America first?” Even if you’re going to do it, don’t talk about it. Unbelievable, what we have to go through, what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight. If they don’t fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. You primary them. We’re going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.
Donald Trump: (14:39)
But this year using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft. There’s never been anything like this. It’s a pure theft in American history, everybody knows it. That election, our election was over at 10:00 in the evening.

He got slaughtered probably, maybe it was okay. Maybe it was that’s what happened. But we look at the facts and our lecture was so corrupt that in the history of this country, we’ve never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.

Our media is not free. It’s not fair. It suppresses thought. It suppresses speech, and it’s become the enemy of the people. It’s become the enemy of the people. It’s the biggest problem we have in this country. No third world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing and you’ll hear about that in just a few minutes. Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It’s like a boxer, and we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We’re going to have to fight much harder and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us. If he doesn’t, that will be a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. After this, we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We’re going to walk down. We’re going to walk down any one you want, but I think right here. We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.
Donald Trump: (18:16)
We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time, far longer than this four-year period. We’ve set it on a much straighter course, a much … I thought four more years. I thought it would be easy. We created-
Donald Trump: (19:03)
Four more years, I thought it would be easy. We created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There’s no President, whether it’s four years, eight years, or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts. It used to take 20 years to get a highway approved. now we’re down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we’re down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down the safety. We created Space Force. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force, which by in of itself is a major achievement for an administration. And with us, it’s one of so many different things.
Donald Trump: (19:52)
Right to try. Everybody know about right to try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets. Our vets, the VA now has the highest rating, 91%, the highest rating that it’s had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always you watch the VA, when it was on television. Every night people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don’t have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can’t get a doctor, you go outside you get the doctor, you have them taken care of. And we pay the doctor. And we’ve not only made life wonderful for so many people, we’ve saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we’ve saved a lot of money.
Donald Trump: (20:49)
And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly. And we have what’s called the VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn’t treat our vets well, or they steal, they rob, they do things badly. We say, “Joe, you’re fired. Get out of here.” Before you couldn’t do that. You couldn’t do that before.
Donald Trump: (21:24)
So we’ve taken care of things. We’ve done things like nobody’s ever thought possible. And that’s part of the reason that many people don’t like us, because we’ve done too much, but we’ve done it quickly. And we were going to sit home and watch a big victory. And everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great. And now we’re out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. Ten o’clock, it was over. But I was going to take a few days.
Donald Trump: (21:52)
And I can say this, since our election, I believe, which was a catastrophe when I watch and even these guys knew what happened, they know what happened. They’re saying, “Wow, Pennsylvania’s insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin, look at the big leads we had.” Even though the press said we were going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said Ohio is going to be close, we set a record. Florida’s going to be close, we set a record. Texas is going to be close. Texas is going to be close, we set a record. And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community. We set a record with everybody.
Donald Trump: (22:36)
Today, we see a very important event though, because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I’m going to be watching, because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity, they’ll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget. With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States.
Donald Trump: (23:21)
And by the way, it’s much more important today than it was 24 hours ago. Because I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup. And I said, “We have no back line anymore.” The only back line, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now what we’re doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.
Donald Trump: (23:59)
I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They’re over there working like you’ve never seen before, studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally got, they gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted, because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later… Again, it took them four years to devise history. And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton because she said, “Why didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Why didn’t you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes! 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing!” But she’s not too happy. You notice you don’t see her anymore. What happened? Where is Hillary? Where is she?
Donald Trump: (24:57)
But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the US Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Shadowless, Kelly Loeffler. And Kelly Loeffler, I’ll tell you, she’s been so great. She works so hard. So let’s give her and David a little special head, because it was rigged against them. Let’s give her and David. Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don’t let them use this stuff. Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Disinvested, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis. Tommy Tuberville, to the coach. And Roger Marshall. We want to thank them, senators that stepped up, we want to thank them.
Donald Trump: (26:04)
I actually think though it takes, again, more courage not to step up. And I think a lot of those people are going to find that out, and you better start looking at your leadership because the leadership has led you down the tubes. “We don’t want to give $2000 to people. We want to give them $600.” Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics. But how does it play politically? China destroyed these people. We didn’t destroy. China destroyed them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600, and they just wouldn’t change. I said, “Give them $2000. We’ll pay it back. We’ll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion. Give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks!”
Donald Trump: (26:57)
And some of the people here disagree with me on that. But I just say, look, you got to let people live. And how does that play though? Okay, number one, it’s the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it’s the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the super primary reason. But you can’t do that. You got to use your head.
Donald Trump: (27:19)
As you know the media is constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. You ever see these people? “While there is no evidence of fraud…” Oh, really? Well, I’m going to read you pages. I hope you don’t get bored listening to it. Promise? Don’t get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please. Yeah. All these people don’t get bored. Don’t get angry at me because you’re going to get bored because it’s so much. The American people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation.
Donald Trump: (27:57)
But it used to be that they’d argue with me, I’d fight. So I’d fight, they’d fight. I’d fight, they’d fight. Boop-boop. You’d believe me, you’d believe them. Somebody comes out. They had their point of view, I had my point of view. But you’d have an argument. Now what they do is they go silent. It’s called suppression. And that’s what happens in a communist country. That’s what they do. They suppress. You don’t fight with them anymore, unless it’s a bad. They have a little bad story about me, they’ll make it 10 times worse and it’s a major headline. But Hunter Biden, they don’t talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? They don’t talk about him.
Donald Trump: (28:34)
Now watch all the sets will go off. Well, they can’t do that because they get good ratings. The ratings are too good. Now where is Hunter? And how come Joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I’d ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ball game. And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow’s wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy, and millions of dollars up front, and how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage? “Have you managed money before?” “No, I haven’t.” “Oh, that’s good. Here’s about 3 billion.”
Donald Trump: (29:29)
No, they don’t talk about that. No, we have a corrupt media. They’ve gone silent. They’ve gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years. I realized how good, even though I didn’t necessarily love him, I realized how good it was like a cleansing motion. But we don’t have that anymore. We don’t have a fair media anymore. It’s suppression and you have to be very careful with that. And they’ve lost all credibility in this country. We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we’ve been forced to believe over the past several weeks. We’ve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.
Donald Trump: (30:27)
You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And when I endorsed him, I didn’t know this guy. At the request of David Perdue. He said, “A friend of mine is running for Governor, what’s his name.” And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don’t know. He was way… He was doing poorly. I endorsed him. He went like a rocket ship and he won. And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams and I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. I was on her last show. Her last week she picked the five outstanding people. I don’t think she thinks that anymore. Once I ran for president, I didn’t notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me, but I was one of the five outstanding people.
Donald Trump: (31:17)
And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama against Stacey. And I had Brian Kemp, he weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I’m trying to figure that. I’m still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, “I was an offensive lineman.” I’m saying, “Really? That must’ve been a really small team.” But I look at that and I look at what’s happened, and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.
Donald Trump: (31:50)
Look, I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them, one in particular I fought. They all said, “Sir, cut him loose. He’s killing us.” The senators, very loyal senators. They’re very loyal people. “Sir, cut him loose. He’s killing us, sir. Cut him loose, sir.” I must’ve gotten half of the senators. I said, “No, I can’t do that. It’s unfair to him. And it’s unfair to the family. He didn’t do anything wrong. They’re made up stories.” They were all made up stories. He didn’t do anything wrong. “Cut him loose, sir.” I said, “No, I won’t do that.” We got him through. And you know what? They couldn’t give a damn. They couldn’t give a damn. Let them rule the right way, but it almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us, and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.
Donald Trump: (32:40)
I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They’re puppets. I read it about Bill Barr, that he’s my personal attorney. That he’ll do anything for me. And I said, “It really is genius,” because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed, if you hadn’t noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn’t want to be considered my personal attorney. And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is I haven’t spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in. But the story is that they’re my puppet. That they’re puppets. And now that the only way they can get out of that, because they hate that, it’s not good on the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let’s rule against Trump, and they do that. So I want to congratulate them.
Donald Trump: (33:41)
But it shows you the media’s genius. In fact, probably, if I was the media, I’d do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out. Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?
Crowd: (34:04)
Yes!
Donald Trump: (34:06)
In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures, that these changes paved the way for fraud on a scale never seen before. And I think we’d go a long way outside of our country when I say that.
Donald Trump: (34:34)
So just in a nutshell, you can’t make a change on voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it, only a legislature. So as an example in Pennsylvania or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature, the legislature laughs at them. Says, “We’re not going to do that.” They say, “Thank you very much.” And they go and make the changes themselves. They do it anyway. And that’s totally illegal. That’s totally illegal. You can’t do that.
Donald Trump: (35:13)
In Pennsylvania, the Democrat Secretary of State and the Democrat State Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election. So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that’s okay. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is their signature verification, 11 days before the election! They say, “We don’t want it.” You know why they don’t want it? Because they want to cheat. That’s the only reason. Who would even think of that? We don’t want to verify a signature? There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Now think of this. You had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had 200… Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody’s imagination. Whatever they needed. So in Pennsylvania you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters! And it’s the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility, unless you want to say it’s a total fraud. So Pennsylvania was defrauded.
Donald Trump: (36:35)
Over 8000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people! Lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more. Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago died. It’s incredible.
Donald Trump: (37:05)
Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters. So these are voters that don’t live in the state. And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome determinative. Meaning these numbers far surpass… I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive. Massive. More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, “They were received after Election Day, let’s count them anyway!” And what they did in many cases is they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back, so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it!
Donald Trump: (38:03)
… they were supposedly mailed out, in other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible. Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let’s send the ballots. Oh, they’ve already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don’t think that’s too good.
Donald Trump: (38:23)
Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal. Indicating an enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation. You’re not allowed to do it. It’s against the law. The day before the election, the State of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased. Nobody knows where it came from by 400,000 ballots. One day after the election, it remains totally unexplained. They said, “Well, we can’t figure that.” Now that’s many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. 400,000 ballots appeared from nowhere, right after the election.
Donald Trump: (39:16)
By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn’t know because it was so quick. They had a vote, they voted, but now they see all this stuff. It’s all come to light. Doesn’t happen that fast. And they want to re certify their votes. They want to re certify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back.
Donald Trump: (39:43)
Mike Pence has to agree to send it back. And many people in Congress want it sent back, and take of what you’re doing. Let’s say you don’t do it. Somebody says, “Well, we have to obey the constitution.” And you are, because you’re protecting our country and you’re protecting the constitution, so you are. But think of what happens. Let’s say they’re stiffs and they’re stupid people. And they say, “Well, we really have no choice.” Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes, they want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly and they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken as I said, because it wasn’t approved by their legislature. That in itself is illegal and then you have the scam and that’s all of the things that we’re talking about. But think of this: if you don’t do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son.
Donald Trump: (40:50)
You will have a president who lost all of these states, or you will have a president to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these things. You will have an illegitimate president, that’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen. These are the facts that you won’t hear from the fake news media. It’s all part of the suppression effort. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off and that’s how a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off, but these are the things you don’t hear about. You don’t hear what you just heard. And I’m going to go over a few more states. But you don’t hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you, big tech, media.
Donald Trump: (41:48)
Just like the suppression polls that said, we’re going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points, well we won Wisconsin. They don’t have it that way because they lose just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before Washington Post, ABC poll, down 17 points. I called up a real pollster. I said, “What is that?” “Sir, that’s called a suppression poll. I think you’re going to win Wisconsin, sir.” I said, “But why do they make it four or five points?” “Because then people vote. But when you’re down 17, they say, ‘Hey, I’m not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there’s no way.'” Despite that, we won Wisconsin, you’ll see. But that’s called suppression because a lot of people, when they see that, it’s very interesting. This pollster said, “Sir, if you’re down three, four or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, ‘Let’s save, let’s go and have dinner, and let’s watch the presidential defeat tonight on television darling.'”
Donald Trump: (42:49)
And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media, every time I put out a tweet, even if it’s totally correct, totally correct. I get a flag. I get a flag. And they also don’t let you get out. On Twitter, it’s very hard to come on to my account. It’s very hard to get out a message. They don’t let the message get out nearly like they should, but I’ve had many people say, “I can’t get on your Twitter.” I don’t care about Twitter. Twitter is bad news. They’re all bad news. But you know what? If you want to get out of message. And if you want to go through big tech, social media, they are really, if you’re a conservative, if you’re a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow ban. Shadow ban. They shadow ban you and it should be illegal. I’ve been telling these Republicans get rid of Section 230.
Donald Trump: (43:47)
And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don’t want to put it in there. And they don’t realize that that’s going to be the end of the Republican party as we know it, but it’s never going to be the end of us, never. Let them get out. Let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength. They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren’t so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It’s all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy and the American people to finally standing up and saying, “No.” This crowd is again a testament to it. I did no advertising. I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that Amy and everybody, we have some incredible supporters, incredible, but we didn’t do anything. This just happened.
Donald Trump: (44:39)
Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, “What are they there for.” “Sir, they’re there for you.” We have nothing to do with it. These groups, they’re forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you’re going to start working on Congress. And we got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world, we got to get rid of them. We got to get rid of them. She never wants a soldier brought home. I’ve brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don’t know, some like it. They’re in countries that nobody even knows the name. Nobody knows where they are. They’re dying. They’re great, but they’re dying. They’re losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home, Afghanistan, Iraq. Remember I used to say in the old days, “Don’t go into Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil.” We didn’t keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid, these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We get nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here. We did good. We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years, people said it couldn’t be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA. Best equipment in the world. In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat run cities deployed more than 500 illegal unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor thin the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need, but there are many things.
Donald Trump: (46:29)
They have these lockboxes and they pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say, “Where’s that box?” They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application. And that’s illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law. And they came 100% from Democrat areas, such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%. In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffel bags on park benches across the city in complete defiance of cease and desist letters from state legislature. The state legislature said, “Don’t do it.” They’re the only ones that could approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes.
Donald Trump: (47:37)
They came in in duffel bags. Where the hell did they come from? According to eyewitness testimony, postal service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state, we love the state, we won the state. In Georgia, your secretary of state, I can’t believe this guy’s a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. I thought it was a great conversation personally, so did a lot of other … people love that conversation, because it says what’s going on. These people are crooked. They’re 100% in my opinion, one of the most corrupt. Between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night, just take a look at what happened, what a mess and the Democrat party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.
Donald Trump: (48:53)
Stacey Abrams, she took them to lunch and I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But the Democrats, took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening, unless he did have a clue. That’s interesting. Maybe he was with the other side, but we’ve been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County. They won’t let us do it. The only reason they won’t is because we’ll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn’t they let us verify signatures and Fulton County? Which is known for being very corrupt. They won’t do it. They go to some other county where you would live. I said, “That’s not the problem. The problem is Fulton County.” Home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job. I congratulate her, but it was done in such a way that we can’t let this stuff happen.
Donald Trump: (49:53)
We won’t have a country of it happens. As a result Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels, because the criteria was so off, 48 counties in Georgia with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots. There wasn’t one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before. The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally, that’s the only way you could explain it. By the way, you’re talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots, as in other years, there should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected, far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000.
Donald Trump: (50:59)
They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that just over 11,000 votes, that’s all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we’re not going to forget it. There’s only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, oppose voter ID and stop citizenship confirmation. Are you in citizenship? You’re not allowed to ask that question. Because they want to steal the election. The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories. In Fulton County, republican poll Watchers were rejected in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst.
Donald Trump: (52:03)
Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes, as that coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 AM. The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia … although he says, I’m a great president. I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, “Yes, I disagree with president, but he’s been a great president.” Oh, good. Thanks. Thank you very much. Because of him and others. Brian Kemp, vote him the hell out of office, please.
Donald Trump: (53:05)
Well, his rates are so low, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low. They’ve rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we’ve identified across the state is staggering. Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election. More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote. More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s own voter rolls. Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the postal service. At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.
Donald Trump: (54:18)
Each one of these is far more than we need. 66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age. And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3rd election. They say they moved right back. They move right back. Oh, they moved out. They moved right back. Okay. They miss Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it’s a corrupt system. Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes. Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big, beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this selection stolen from you, from me and from the country. And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contestant state before the election is certified.
Donald Trump: (55:21)
In the State of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. 2000 ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven’t mailed them yet. 11,600 more ballots and votes were counted more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.
Donald Trump: (55:51)
150,000 people registered in Maya Copa County after the registration deadline. 103,000 ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers. In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots. If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through. There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150, 000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020, prior to November 3rd election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn’t live there. The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number. Any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won-
Donald Trump: (57:03)
Any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada also. Every one of these we’re going over, we win. In Michigan quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications, sent to every person on the rolls, in direct violation of state law. More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth matched people who were deceased. In Wayne County, that’s a great one. That’s Detroit. 174,000 ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from. Also in Wayne County, poll watches observed canvassers re-scanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times. In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan, Detroit, Michigan.
Donald Trump: (58:08)
A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat, while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn’t talk to him. The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That’s Michigan. Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.
Donald Trump: (59:10)
At 6:31 AM, in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump. Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary. You know what’s interesting, President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed him. But the swing States were the ones that mattered. There were always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within the number of hours we were losing by a little.
Donald Trump: (01:00:03)
In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting systems. In one Michigan County alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country. Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, Senator Ligon, highly respected on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia.
Donald Trump: (01:00:40)
He wrote, and I quote, “The Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate.” It’s only wrong 93% of the time. “In the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter’s interest, in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.” Think of it, you go in and you vote and then they tell people who you’re supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody’s ever even heard. They adjudicate your vote. They say, “Well, we don’t think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.” The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you’re at 93%. ” The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.”
Donald Trump: (01:01:44)
The letter continues, “There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia. For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29, 391 votes at 9:11 PM Eastern time. While simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391.” And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch, all in Mr. Biden’s favor.
Donald Trump: (01:02:31)
So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state and all of these legislatures want this back. I don’t want to do it to you because I love you and it’s freezing out here, but I could just go on forever. I can tell you this…
Speaker 1: (01:02:52)
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.
Donald Trump: (01:03:03)
So when you hear, when you hear, “While there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing,” this is the most fraudulent thing anybody’s… This is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise and the press will say, and I’m sure they won’t put any of that on there because that’s no good, do you ever see, “While there is no evidence to back President Trump’s assertion,” I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There’s never been anything like it. Think about it, Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more, but you don’t have to go any… Between that, I think that’s almost better than dead people, if you think, right? More votes than they had voters, and many other States are also.
Donald Trump: (01:03:56)
It’s a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification. In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency, or eligibility of the votes cast. The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight, they want to play so, “Sir, yes, the United States, the constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the States.” Well, I say, “Yes, it does because the constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our constitution and you can’t vote on fraud,” and fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to. It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don’t want to clean them up, they are loaded. And how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one who got seven ballots. And then they say, “You didn’t quite make it, sir.” We won. We won in a landslide. This was a landslide.
Donald Trump: (01:05:43)
They said, “It’s not American to challenge the election.” This is the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world. You know, you could go third world countries, but I don’t think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don’t have voters for them. I mean, no matter where you go, nobody would think this. In fact, it’s so egregious, it’s so bad, that a lot of people don’t even believe it. It’s so crazy that people don’t even believe it. It can’t be true. So they don’t believe it. This is not just a matter of domestic politics, this is a matter of national security. So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. Today is not the end. It’s just the beginning.
Donald Trump: (01:06:37)
With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that. I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fake news, and they challenge almost everything we say. But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There’s never been a movement like that. You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It’s hard to believe. We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again, but we’re going forward. We’ll take care of going forward. We got to take care of going back. Don’t let them talk, “Okay, well we promise,” I’ve had a lot of people, “Sir, you’re at 96% for four years.” I said, “I’m not interested right now. I’m interested in right there.”
Donald Trump: (01:07:33)
With your help we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash your check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote. We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually. We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. There for, they get… They disappear and then all of a sudden they show up. It’s fraudulent. We will stop the practice of universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting. We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who cast a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner. We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on election day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice. We will finally hold big tech accountable and if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world, has.
Donald Trump: (01:09:10)
All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections and it has to be stopped and the Republicans have to get a lot tougher and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They’re totally breaking the law. Together we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation’s capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it’s easy, it’s a dirty business. It’s a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there. Despite everything we’ve been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds, although this I think is our all time record. I think you have 250, 000 people. 250,000.
Donald Trump: (01:10:05)
Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation’s future. Well, I have to say we have to be a little bit careful. That’s a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement. If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country, because it’s illegal when the votes are illegal, when the way they got there is illegal, when the States that vote are given false and fraudulent information. We are the greatest country on earth and we are headed, and were headed, in the right direction. You know, the wall is built, we’re doing record numbers at the wall. Now they want to take down the wall. Let’s let everyone flow in. Let’s let everybody flow in.
Donald Trump: (01:10:52)
We did a great job in the wall. Remember the wall? They said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we’ve ever had in this country and it’s had a tremendous impact and we got rid of catch and release, we got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with. But now the caravans, they think Biden’s getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can’t let it happen. As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country. We have overwhelming pride in this great country, and we have it deep in our souls. Together we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.
Donald Trump: (01:11:44)
Our brightest days are before us, our greatest achievements still wait. I think one of our great achievements will be election security because nobody until I came along, had any idea how corrupt our elections were. And again, most people would stand there at 9:00 in the evening and say, “I want to thank you very much,” and they go off to some other life, but I said, “Something’s wrong here. Something’s really wrong. Can’t have happened.” And we fight. We fight like Hell and if you don’t fight like Hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.
Donald Trump: (01:12:21)
Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans for our movement, for our children and for our beloved country and I say this, despite all that’s happened, the best is yet to come.
Donald Trump: (01:12:43)
So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats are hopeless. They’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.
Donald Trump: (01:13:19)
So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all for being here, this is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Crowd: (00:00)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (02:11)
Well, I want to thank you very much. Hello, Georgia, by the way. There’s no way we lost Georgia. There’s no way. That was a rigged election, but we’re still fighting it and you’ll see what’s going to happen. We’ll talk about it. I just want to thank you. This is some crowd. Biden was here today, also. They had 14 people in three cars. No, there was no way. I just want to thank you. I’ve had two elections. I won both of them. It’s amazing. I actually did much better on the second one. It’s great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country. Tomorrow, each of you is going to vote in one of the most important runoff elections of the history of our country. Frankly, forget about runoff. One of the most important elections, really. It’s really not runoff. It’s elections because it’s a biggie. Our country’s depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. You’ve got to swamp them because everything’s so crooked around. I mean, and not here.
Donald Trump: (03:26)
They were saying, “Oh, he’s complaining about Georgia.” No, no. I’m complaining about eight different states, and I think we’re going to win them all. You’re going to get everyone you know. You’re going to show up at the polls in record numbers. You got to swamp them and together we’re going to defeat the Democratic streamers and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue. Where’s David? David, David. We love our David. I know David so well. He’s respected and loved by everyone. And someone that has really been a star in Washington, Kelly Loeffler. Where is Kelly? Where is our Kelly? What a job you’ve done. Thank you. I will tell you about Kelly.
Crowd: (04:29)
Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump!
Donald Trump: (04:30)
Kelly fights for me. David fights for me, that I can tell you. I will also say the Republicans, you have to understand, for the people that don’t fight, not for me, fighting for us because we have a lot of corrupt things that happen when they don’t fight. One thing I’ve learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don’t have? They never forget. They never forget. People are going to find that out because we have to go and we have to go all the way and that’s what’s happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks. You watch what’s going to come out. Watch what’s going to be revealed. You watch.
Donald Trump: (05:17)
I have to tell you that the stakes of this election could not be higher. You vote tomorrow. You want to go out tomorrow. People want to go out. They don’t want to do the ballot thing. Don’t want to do it unless it’s the other side, in which case they just print them out. They don’t want to do it. They want to go and vote and make sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don’t let you say, “I’m sorry. Somebody else has already voted for you.” Your vote tomorrow will decide which party controls the United States Senate. The radical Democrats are trying to capture Georgia’s Senate seats so they can wield unchecked, unrestrained, absolute power over every aspect of your lives. If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House… And they’re not taking this White House. We’re going to fight like hell, I’ll tell you right now.
Donald Trump: (06:14)
I was telling Kelly before, you can lose and that’s acceptable. You lose, you lose. You go, and you go wherever you’re going and you go and say, “Maybe I’ll do it again sometime, or maybe I won’t or I’ll get back to life.” But when you win in a landslide and they steal it and it’s rigged, it’s not acceptable. Not acceptable. Then you have a country that would be run, if these two don’t win, and if we don’t take the presidency, you have a country that would be run by Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden. The people of Georgia will be at the mercy of the left wing, socialist, communist, Marxists. That’s where it’s going. We don’t like to use the word communist.
Donald Trump: (07:04)
How about the press? Look at them back there. Look at all of them. How about the press? That’s a lot of press. Oh, boy. That’s a lot of press. But they’ve gone silent now. They have a new thing. They used to fight me left, right. I’d go, they’d go. You’d fight. I’d win. They’d win. Who knows who wins? But people would hear. Now they don’t want to talk about it. Unless they can say something bad about you, they don’t want to talk about it. So if we talk about certain subjects, as you’ve been watching over the last six months, all of a sudden they were getting clobbered so they went stone cold silent. Big tech, the fake news media, they go silent anymore. They don’t talk about it, and that is the beginning of communism. That’s exactly what happens.
Donald Trump: (07:53)
Because I think they hate our country and they despise Georgia values. I think a lot of you despise them as you know there’s nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they’re trying to do with us. We’re not going to let it happen over the pass, and I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much. No, Mike is a great guy. He’s a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he’s going to have a lot to say about it. One thing with him, you’re going to get straight shots. He’s going to call it straight. Over the past few weeks, we’ve demonstrated that we won the election in a landslide. Almost 75 million people voted for me, the most of any incumbent president in the history of our country.
Donald Trump: (09:09)
We won over 11 million, close to 12 million, more votes than 2016. One of the largest, actually, the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won went to a second term or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That’s a record, and they said we didn’t win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. I think we have one that we’re waiting for, right? Did you see the one in… Hello, Mike. How are you, Mike?
Donald Trump: (10:14)
Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman… They keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. “She’s up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes.” That’s the same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead… And Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man. My coattails, we swept our Republican House candidates to victory and we have a couple of great ones with us tonight, and the Democrats lost 14 seats. It was supposed to be the other way around. When that happens, no president loses unless they play games. You don’t lose. They play games. The fact is we won the presidential election. We won it big and we’re going to win tomorrow. We’re going to win it really big.
Donald Trump: (11:08)
We have to. We have to. People have no idea how important that is. Tonight, our mission here in Georgia is to make sure the radical left cannot rob you of your voice and your votes in Washington. You can’t lose these two people. I really know them well. They’re the most respected people. They’re great people and they really do have a voice and they love their state and they love their country. The Democrats are trying to steal the White House. You can not let them. You just can’t let them steal the U.S. Senate. You can’t let it happen. You can’t let it happen. David and Kelly are running against the most extreme liberal candidates in the history of your state, probably in the history of our country, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Well, I beat Ossoff once running against a very fine woman, Karen, who you know, and he was at 57 and I got involved and we drove him down to 49 and then he ended up in a runoff and she ended up winning. Now I have to beat him a second time. This is going to be, hopefully, easy because when you know what he stands for, when you know what Warnock stands for, it really should be easy. Cast deciding votes to rubber stamp the agenda of AOC and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. Stacey Abrams. What’s with this Stacey Abrams? Your governor and your secretary of state, they’re petrified of Stacey Abrams. What’s that all about? Did you see this consent decree they signed with signature verification? You can forget about it. What they have done to your state. I think most people have no idea what they’ve done to your state. That consent decree or these two people. I don’t know. They say they’re Republicans. I really don’t think they are. They can’t be.
Donald Trump: (13:19)
If we want to have a special session, because your legislature’s excellent, they want to have a… Why wouldn’t they let us have a special session? If they want to check signatures in Fulton County, not in Cobb County. We didn’t ask for Cobb County. They said, “We’ll do Cobb first and then we’ll do Fulton.” They do Cobb. Then they never get to Fulton. Why wouldn’t they do that? Why wouldn’t they do that? That’s a positive thing. Anyway, the Democrats want to turn America. I’ll be here in about a year and a half campaigning against your governor, I guarantee you that. I shouldn’t say this. I shouldn’t say this because I just don’t want you to tell anybody outside of this room, other than the millions of people now, but I endorsed him. He was in last place and I endorsed him. He went to first place immediately, and then he won the primary, and then I gave him a couple of rallies, which I don’t like doing for other people. I was telling Kelly, ” do rallies for other people. I do them for me, right?” Not that easy, a crowd like this. They say over 25,000 people. Over what? Over a couple of days notice. Is everybody glad you’re here, right? I think so. There is no place like a Trump rally, but you know what? This is a Kelly rally and a David rally. I wouldn’t do it unless I loved them both. I wouldn’t do it. But I’m going to be here in a year and a half and I’m going to be campaigning against your governor and your crazy secretary of state, that I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (15:04)
You have great candidates. They want to turn, the Democrats do, America into Venezuela with no jobs, no prosperity, no rights, no freedom, no future for you and your family. Here is exactly what the radical left will do if they win this runoff election, which we can’t let them do tomorrow. Tomorrow’s a big day. I guess we have to get over a million votes tomorrow, right, Kelly? Over a million. All right. That’s a lot of votes, Kelly, but we’ll do it. The one thing I know, if they win I’ll get no credit, and if they lose they’re going to blame Trump, these people. Kelly won’t let that happen. Please win tomorrow. You’re going to win so big, it’s going to be great story. It’s a great story, a very important story for our country, long beyond Georgia for our country. It’s such a big story. They’ll massively raise your taxes on the middle class to pay for socialism. The U.S. military, which we rebuilt. We’ve totally rebuilt the U.S. military, much of it coming right out of Georgia.
Donald Trump: (16:17)
We built it right out of Georgia, a lot of it. You have incredible contractors in Georgia, military contractors, and they got plenty of our money. Spent $2.5 trillion. When I took over the military, it was absolutely a mess. It was depleted. Now it’s the opposite of depleted. The U.S. military will be gutted and military families across the street and all over the state will be betrayed. Their benefits and opportunities will be slashed. Fort Benning, Fort Gordon and other Georgia military institutions will be the first on the chopping block. By the way, there’ll be forced to change the names of the bases where generations of American patriots trained to win two World Wars. I don’t know. Fort Benning. Let’s see. Give me a couple of names. I could give you some. I don’t want to give them the credit, but you’ll name them.
Donald Trump: (17:09)
You’ll name them after other people. Fort Trump. Yeah. How about that? I like that. Yeah, let’s change the name. Let’s change it. Kelly, let’s change it. If they name it Trump, let’s change it. No. Now they’re going to go back and say, “He wants to have Fort Benning changed to Trump.” Watch, they’ll say, “He’s asking, he’s begging for Fort Benning to be changed to Trump.” No, no. I don’t want that. The Democrats will surrender the entire U.S. manufacturing industry to China. You notice they never criticize China, right? They never… It’s Russia, Russia, Russia. I saw it today again. Russia, Russia. Oh, Russia. Here we go. That was another great scam. I’ve been involved in the two greatest scams in American history, the Russian hoax, and now they are trying to steal an election from us. We won not by a little bit. We won in numbers like nobody’s seen before.
Donald Trump: (18:08)
If Ossoff and Warnock are elected, they will immediately [inaudible 00:18:12] and you know what’s going to happen. They’ll throw open American borders and allow tens of millions of illegal immigrants to pour into our country from every corner of the globe. Your schools, your hospitals and your communities will be overwhelmed. And the wall, the wall, the wall. Remember, we’ll build a wall. We’re going to build a wall. And that’s right, Mexico is paying for the wall. If I were here, they would be, because we were going to charge them a nice fee, right at the entry points. They were paying for the wall. They paid for 28,000 troops along the wall and along the border, which we don’t need so much anymore, but we built almost 500 miles of wall and they want to rip down the wall. They want to rip down.
Donald Trump: (18:57)
It’s why the numbers have been so great. But now everyone’s coming back up because they think this guy’s going to win. If he wins, it’s going to be everything that they could dream for, dream of. We want to help other people, but we can’t afford to do it. We can’t afford to do it. So, they’re coming up now, the caravans. Remember the caravans? The caravans are starting to form. Here they come. But let’s keep this thing going. We have great support in Congress. We have good support in the Senate. I wouldn’t say great. Could be better. But people will remember the people that don’t support us. If they win this race, Democrats will implement nationwide catch and release. You know what that is? You catch a criminal and you take his name. You say, “You’re released into our country.” I ended it.
Donald Trump: (19:49)
You’re released. Come back in four years. We’re going to take you to court. So far nobody’s ever shown up. I mean, literally they almost don’t show up. That’s when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, “No, they don’t.” I turned out to be right. Did they apologize? I don’t think so. And turn our entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, setting loose tens of thousands of dangerous offenders and putting MS13 gang members straight into your children’s schools. We’ve removed thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members. I want to thank ICE and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank our great law enforcement. Incredible people. They’re incredible.
Donald Trump: (20:39)
The people that understand those values are Kelly and David. They understand those values. You’re with our law enforcement, right? A hundred percent. I don’t have to ask her that. They’ll allow heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs to flood across our borders again, and poison our youth. They’ll take away your healthcare. They’ll eliminate private insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private insurance. You can forget about it. You’ll lose your doctor. Remember President Obama said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” Guess what? He said it 28 times. That was a lie. That was a lie. That turned out to be a big, great scam lie. Remember, I got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, fighting a lot of different fronts, which really doesn’t make it Obamacare anymore, by the way. They’ll resume the war on Christians and attack Catholic organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor. They will ban voter ID. We want voter ID. Is that so much to ask? And institute universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting in every state.
Donald Trump: (21:54)
They will never be… I’ll tell you this. If we don’t do something fast, there will never be another fair election in America. We’re known for elections and now we’re being laughed out all over the world about this last election. You’ve got to swarm it tomorrow. Now, the good thing about tomorrow, it’s one state so you have a lot of eyeballs watching. It’s tougher than when you have 50 states and they do it to various states. I’ve never seen anything like it. I was leading in Pennsylvania by hundreds of thousands of votes. All of a sudden I was tied. I said, “What happened?” They’ll make Washington DC and other liberal places the 51st, 52nd, 53rd States of the Union guaranteeing the radical left a permanent majority of the U.S. Senate and the House and the electoral college. It will make it, really, a one party country, and the party will be the wrong party. They will pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists and I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not…
Donald Trump: (23:03)
Extremists. And I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not stepping up to the plate. They’re not stepping up. How about that? Look at the Supreme Court, President of the United States. I want to file suit. I want to do… And they say, “Sir, you can’t, you really can’t do that.” Why? So they have legal reasons, complex legal reasons. It’s wrong. If you’re the President of the United States, and you get defrauded out of an election, you should be able to file a suit, but we can’t do that. They say, “Sir, you don’t have standing.” How about that? I’m the president, seven states, You know, I was winning by a lot. And then all of a sudden I was losing by a little, tiny bit, just a little, they can only go so far. They had no idea we were going to do the kind of numbers. So that printing press was really moving.
Donald Trump: (23:57)
And they say, I don’t have standing to bring a suit. What kind of a legal system is that? But the Supreme Court has led us down so far. Who knows? Maybe they’ll come back. Maybe they’ll come back. They’ll pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists. Then there’ll be saying, “You know, I should have done something about this.” When they start having 24, 25, 26 justices, and they want to have the justices rotate to the lowest courts. So they’ll rotate. These nine justices will have a great time rotating, but they’re bent on destroying our constitution and overthrowing America’s founding.
Donald Trump: (24:37)
If the left wins these Senate seats, they will abolish the Senate. You know this. The filibuster, they will knock it out. I’ve been saying, to be honest with you for a long time, they’re going to do that, at some point, they’re going to do that. And why don’t we do it first? I said it. If they’re going to do it, you might as well do it first. And now everybody said, “You were right.” But you know what? I want to be wrong, because I want these two to win. Because if they win, we don’t want to do it. It’s a bad thing for our country. But that would give them the power to ram through every diluted piece of left-wing legislation that they’ve ever wanted, that they’ve ever dreamt up. Your religious liberty will be gone. Your second amendment will be gone. Your borders and great new world will be gone. Your police departments will be gone as we know them, and your life savings will be gone. We’ll be like a large scale version of so many other countries that you look at. That are poverty.
Donald Trump: (25:36)
America as you know it will be over. And it will never, I believe, be able to come back again. It will be too far gone. Your vote tomorrow could lose, and it could be your last chance to save the America that we love. That’s why I’m here. I don’t want to do rallies for other people. I told you. I’m here because of that. Because of David and Kelly, the far left wants to destroy our country, demolish our history, and erase everything that we hold dear. This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life. It really could be. This is so important. I mean, think of it. It’s so important. It’s amazing actually, that in one state you have two races simultaneously. I don’t think a thing like that’s ever happened before. If you don’t show up, the radical Democrats will win. A lot of people say, “Oh, well, Trump, maybe he wants it that way.” No. You know what I want? I want a great country. I want these two very special people to be elected.
Donald Trump: (26:40)
And I want to be clear. If those of you that know how badly screwed we got, I want to be clear that we can’t let that happen again. We can’t let that happen again. We’re going to come back, and I really believe we’re going to take what they did to us in November 3rd. We’re going to take it back. But these two people, they can’t go through this. They can’t go through it. If you don’t go and vote, the socialists, the Marxists, will be in charge of our country. If you don’t fight to save your country with everything you have, you’re not going to have a country left. I love this state. This state’s been very good to me. We’ve had a lot of victories in this state, just had one on November 3rd actually. And I love the people of this state. We can’t let that happen. The damage they do will be permanent, and will be irreversible. Can’t let it happen.
Donald Trump: (27:42)
Nothing and no one will be able to stop them. These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense. Now I must preface that by saying, because they’ll say, “He just conceded.” No, no, I concede. So Kelly, if I might add, I think we’re going to win, in which case we’ll be the last line of defense, it’s called veto, veto, veto. Veto. So tomorrow, you must get out and vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Over the last four years, David Purdue has been one of our greatest allies and strongest defenders in Washington. He’s a great gentlemen. David was a critical vote in the right to pass the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We did that together. We got it done, launching an incredible economic boom. The greatest tax cuts in the history of our country, think of it. And the greatest restrictions, we were so restricted we couldn’t breathe in this country. That’s one of the big, I think it might’ve been more important in many ways than the tax cuts. You would know that being one of the great businessmen of our world.
Donald Trump: (28:56)
I think it was maybe more important. When Georgia needed a strong voice in Washington after Hurricane Michael, remember Hurricane Michael? And I was down here with David, but David Purdue led the charge to get the workers and farmers of your state the relief you deserved. He said, “Sir, can we get a billion dollars?” And I said, “We’re going to get it David. And we got it very fast.” And there was no mechanism to get it. You got hit with a hurricane like you have never seen before, came in from a location that is just very unique. It was a horrible thing. I was here for a long time with David, and he worked and his kin, his kin, the great Sonny Perdue, our Department of Agriculture, our Secretary of Agriculture was fantastic also, but we worked very hard, and we got the farmers and the businesses the money that they had to have. And now they’re thriving. David has also been one of the most courageous advocates fighting for an immigration system that defends American workers, American wages, American families, and American jobs. He led the effort in Congress to build the wall. That’s right.
Donald Trump: (30:08)
And Kelly helped on that she’s a little bit newer to the Senate, but she helped a lot. Those last moments you were there, without you it wouldn’t have happened, actually. Cracked out on deadly sanctuary cities, and chain migration and institute on parallel protection for our great citizens. He fought to help us replaced NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA, they said it couldn’t be done. A giant victory for Georgia, for workers, and for farmers all over our country. NAFTA was the worst trade deal probably ever signed. And that maybe has to exclude some of the crazy deals and things they did with China. We voted to confirm nearly 300 federal judges. We have a record on federal judges, and three Supreme Court justices, which is a tremendous thing. We have almost 300 federal judges committed to interpreting our constitution as written. No one fights harder for the people of Georgia than David Purdue. David’s opponent, Jon Ossoff is an unhinged radical leftist. He’s not a senator. He’s not a senator. That’s not a Senator. Ossoff said that he’s very proud to be endorsed by socialist crazy Bernie Sanders.
Donald Trump: (31:28)
He’s weak on China. He promoted Chinese propaganda and then he failed to disclose his business ties to the Chinese communist party. Other than that, he’s a wonderful guy, right? Ossoff supports the largest tax hike in American history. If they get in, Warnock and Ossoff, if they get in, you’re going to have the largest tax increase that you’ve ever had. It’ll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country. For what? The Green New Deal, let’s rip down a building because its windows are too big. Let’s build a building with no windows. Among many other things. He supports the insane Green New Deal, which would crush middle-class parents trying to raise a family. He will support the socialist takeover of American healthcare, which will lead to rationing poverty and death. Ossoff also backed the radical left wing crusade to defund police. The last summer, he proudly joined the anti-police mob, he didn’t like the police. He doesn’t like our police. We love our police. Slandering our brave men and women in blue.
Donald Trump: (32:40)
If you vote for Jon Ossoff, he will attack our heroes. He will destroy our economy, and he will betray you and your family. And it’ll happen very quickly. That’s why you must vote. And really importantly, get out tomorrow. Vote for David Perdue. He’s a great gentleman. He loves you. Georgia has another fantastic champion in Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly is a staunch defender of our incredible military. I’m so proud of our military. She supports the wall, and she always stands with the heroes of law enforcement, ICE and border patrol. I hated it, Kelly, when we got ballots in from the military with Trump all over it, and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump. Boom, goes into the river. That was just one of many instances of problem. Kelly is also a committed protector of your second amendment rights. With Kelly’s vote, we confirmed our third new Supreme Court justice Amy Coney Barrett.
Donald Trump: (33:50)
Working with David, Kelly helped rescue the US economy from the China virus, passing nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saving over 1.5 million Georgia jobs, and rescuing countless small businesses all across your state. Businesses that now are doing really well, and we also came up with a vaccine. Nobody else would have done that. They would have done that in 10 years. Kelly and David also both strongly support my efforts to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to hardworking Americans across Georgia, and across the nation. And my reasoning is simple. I mean, we’re conservative with money, but my reasoning is simple. You didn’t cause this problem, this problem was caused by China. Kelly is running against a hard left extremist named Raphael Warnock. Warnock is the most radical and dangerous left-wing candidate ever to seek this office, and certainly in the state of Georgia, and he does not have your values. Warnock has publicly declared his support for socialism, and he once welcomed the anti-American communist dictator, Fidel Castro to his church. He wanted him here. He liked Castro. Thought Castro was a nice guy.
Donald Trump: (35:13)
Warnock said that quote, nobody can serve both God and the military. A vicious smear against thousands of patriotic service members across the state of Georgia. He wants to abolish cash bail. You see how that’s working in New York City, right? It’s not working too well. He has called for quote, opening up the jails, and he slandered our police offices as gangsters, thugs, and bullies. The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are fringe extremists, who would wreck everything Georgia patriots hold dear to their hearts. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue share your values, and you know that. They share your values like nobody shares your values. I can tell you, they share your values. They want to defend your interest. And they will always put America first.
Donald Trump: (36:12)
Did you see the other day? What a great name, America First. They announced they don’t want to do the America First policy. How crazy? Even if you’re not going to do it, which is basically protect us. We come first. But even, and that includes financially in every other way. Even if you don’t believe it, you don’t say we’re going to end America First. They want to end America First. Kelly, I’d love you to just come up and say a few words. Would that be okay? Kelly.
Kelly Loeffer: (36:39)
Hello, Georgia. Thank you Georgia. I have an announcement Georgia. On January 6th, I will object to the electoral college votes. That’s right. That’s right. Thank you. We’re going to get this done. All right, Georgia. But I have a very important question for you. Are you ready to show America that Georgia’s a red state? That’s right. That’s right. Look, this president fought for us, we’re fighting for him. He put America first. He put the American worker first. Thank you, Mr. President. He stood with our men and women of law enforcement. He restored our military. My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, He attacked our police, our military. He spoke out against Israel, evangelicals, small businesses. Georgia, we have to hold the line. You have to get out and vote tomorrow. Georgia, we are the firewall to socialism. We have to get it done. I love you guys. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (38:38)
We love you. Thank you. Thank you Kelly. That was nice. I’m glad I invited her up. Kelly, I’m glad I invited you up. That was great. Thank you Kelly. That was so great.
Crowd: (38:52)
Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump. Fight for Trump.
Donald Trump: (39:01)
Thank you. Thank you. You know, it really is. It’s fight for our country. It’s really fight for our country, not fight for Trump. It’s fight for our country, because that’s why we’re fighting for. Also joining us tonight are Georgia representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene. I love Marjorie Taylor too. Where are you? Come up here. Kelly wants you to come up here. Don’t mess with her. Don’t mess with her.
Marjorie: (39:38)
Hello, Northwest Georgia. All right. Let me tell you something. I’m so fired up to hear Senator Kelly Loeffler. She’s going to object on January 6th. This is why I believe in her. You see, when you have a strong Senator Kelly Loeffler from Georgia fighting for you, and fighting for your president, and protecting your vote, this is why you have to turn out tomorrow, right? Yes. We have to save our Senate seats. We have to save America and stop socialism. This is the last line. We aren’t going to hand over our Senate seats to a pastor who preaches abortion from the pulpit. No. He’s preaching murder of God’s creation in the womb, holding a Bible in his hand.
Marjorie: (40:48)
If anything, go out there and vote for the unborn tomorrow. We’ve had enough. We’re not going to let Georgia go to two radical socialists. No. I need you all to go out there and vote. Our district has to show up. We’ve got to stop this attack. Stop our senate seats from being hand over to these radicals. And we’re going to fight for president Trump on January 6th. God bless Georgia, God bless America. Let’s do this.
Crowd: (41:30)
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Donald Trump: (41:49)
I also want to introduce two great warriors, friends of mine, Andrew Clyde and Jody Hice. Jody, thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. Great job. We have another friend of ours, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. And Mike Lee is here too, but I’m a little angry at him today. Where’s Mike Lee, Where is he? I’m a little angry at you today, but that’s… State representative Vernon Jones. What a great guy he is. A great man. And an early supporter of mine who’s also on the ballot tomorrow. Public service commissioner Bubba McDonald. Bubba. You’re going to do great.
Crowd: (42:43)
Bubba. Bubba. Bubba. Bubba. Bubba. Bubba. Bubba. Bubba.
Donald Trump: (42:43)
Great guy. Thank you, Bubba. Thank you. Good luck tomorrow. You’ll do well. Georgia Republican party chairman David Schaefer, and he’s fighting. He’s out there. He is fighting. He is fighting. By the way, I also want to say hello to, Kelly’s husband is one of the great entrepreneurs in our country. He’s respected by everybody. He’s a tough guy, but he is a sweetheart, and he loves your state. I just want to say hello. Do you mind? Okay. He doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want it, but I will tell, you he’s respected as a businessman, respected by everybody, and gives tremendous amounts of money to charity and everything else. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (43:35)
Also a friend of mine, and I don’t know what it is. I’m not so good with the bikes. I sort of say, maybe I stay away from it a little bit, but Chris Cox is Bikers for Trump. And he’s the founder, and he had more people show up for me. Whenever I saw, I’d go to places, I’d have two, three, 4,000 bikes, and secret service would go crazy. I’d say, “No, I’m so happy.” And they wouldn’t do it for any other reason. They just wanted to protect their future president. This was before I won, they were with me for whatever reason, bikers like me. And I like them. Chris Cox, wherever you are Chris Cox. Where is Chris? I don’t know why the bikers like me, Chris, but they do. But I like you guys a lot, and you’re great. We go to speeches and we’d be packed, and we couldn’t even get them, they didn’t even want to be inside. They stood outside. And they were protecting their president when I became president, I never felt safer in my life. Thank you. That’s true.
Donald Trump: (44:37)
Another man who’s respected by everybody, a friend of mine. David McIntosh Club for Growth. David, David. Thank you, David. Respected by everybody. And I want to thank Don Jr. Did he do a good job tonight? I watched. Where is Don? Don is great. I love Don. They love our Don, but he’s working hard, and I want to thank Don and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is incredible. And I also came with somebody who people like a lot, people like her a lot. I don’t know. She doesn’t really like the concept of running for office. She says, “What do I need it for, dad?” Ivanka. Where’s Ivanka? Come on, come, come. Should we get Ivanka up yes, right? Come on up here honey.
Ivanka Trump: (46:03)
Hello Georgia. It is so incredible to be back here with so many amazing, hardworking Georgia families who are fighting for our children’s future. Each one of you. And it’s so great to be back in Georgia with this warrior, my father, the people’s president. He is a tireless, a tireless champion for all of you, and he will never stop fighting. And by his side are two amazing senators that we have to send back to the Senate and send a resounding message that patriotism is alive and well in Georgia. And Georgia is going to keep freedom alive in America. Please vote. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia and God bless America, and God bless our president.
Donald Trump: (47:35)
Thank you Ivanka. Thanks Don. Kimberly, everybody. Thank you all. Tomorrow our entire nation is counting on the people of Georgia in a way the world is counting on the people of Georgia. The fate of our country is at stake. It’s in your hands. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can’t steal it or cheat it away. We have all … They’ll be trying though, I’ll tell you that. We have all seen what our opponents are capable of doing. I ran two elections. I won both of them. Second one, much more successful than the first, but we can’t let this happen any longer. On election night, we were leading by so much. We’re not going to have that tomorrow. We’re not going to have that tomorrow night, where you’re leading and then all of a sudden, boom, it’s gone like magic. We won Florida and Ohio in record numbers.
Donald Trump: (48:32)
We won Iowa by 8.2%. Nobody’s ever won those three States and lost. Never happened before. It’s almost impossible unless people do a lot of … Either get very lucky or they cheat. We’re up 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Washington. In Wisconsin we were way up, 356,000 votes. In Georgia, 356,000 and 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It was over. I should have run up to the podium and said, thank you very much for this wonderful victory. Then maybe they wouldn’t have had time to close those booths, the counting rooms, and do what they did. But then it all started to disappear. I tell this story because we can’t let this happen tomorrow, Kelly. So keep your eyes open. Since the election, we have put forth indisputable evidence documenting the rampant fraud, which will be announced on Wednesday as you know.
Donald Trump: (49:48)
And I want to thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that have stepped up to fight, because they’ve seen what happens. They know it’s a fraud and not just here. I watched some of the people on Fox. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to. I didn’t have enough channels. And they said, “Why is he fighting for Georgia? It’s not enough.” And I need three. I’m fighting in eight, actually, but six and we’re going to win them all. But they said, “Why?” So one of the people, a very fine woman actually, but she said, “Why is he fighting Georgia? It doesn’t get him there.” I said, “No, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me there. And we have six and maybe eight, if you look at them and we were leading all of them by a lot, until, like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear.”
Donald Trump: (50:45)
Right here in Georgia there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We were up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. Then your wacky secretary of state said two people, two people. Now, I don’t know how many people are on that list, but it’s a lot of people. 2,506 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren’t all there, but they did a lot of work. They paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. 4,502 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s voter rolls. Well, that’s sort of strange. 18,325 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can’t believe that happened.
Donald Trump: (52:13)
66,000 votes … You have to understand, we’re down by a little more than 11,000. So every one of these is determinative. 66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don’t know. I mean, I can’t tell. They moved out, ah, let’s go back. Usually takes a little time, right? We moved out. Let’s go back, darling. Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. 48 out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by [inaudible 00:53:36]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I’m going over individual. In all of the swing States. Now they’ll check this out and that’s fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent official suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago. They don’t want to do it. The secretary of state and your incompetent governor. Although he thinks I’ve been a great president. They illegally flooded their States with absentee ballots and they deployed hundreds of elicit ballot drop boxes and corrupt Democrat run cities, among many other flagrant violations of law.
Donald Trump: (54:52)
They put these drop boxes there. And in a number of they’d be gone for three days. They’d take them up and where are they? Where are they? They were gone. Georgia secretary of state agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody’s ever seen one like this. I want to just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners. That drastically and illegally changed the states election procedures. They never got the mandated approval from your state legislature, who, by the way, you have some great people in your legislature. Some great, great people who agree with what we’re saying and even more so.
Donald Trump: (55:35)
But think of it. They never got the approval. You have to, by law, under the constitution, you can’t just do these deals and not get the approval and your secretary of state or whoever it was, made this horrible consent decree, horrible, which got rid of so much safety. It’s a disgraceful thing. And it was only approved by your local politicians, him, and local judges. You can’t do that. You have to have your state legislatures do it. That’s true with all States. Tens of thousands of votes are missing. We go all over the world telling people how to run their elections and we don’t even know how to run ours. The most unhappy person right now, anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton. Because she’s asking the Democrat party, why the hell didn’t you do this for me? True. Why didn’t you do it for me? Why the hell didn’t you? You notice how quiet she’s been? I shouldn’t have said that, not tonight Jill. But you notice how quiet … she’s furious, because she said, “Don’t forget, I won Michigan by 10,000 votes.” We did much better. As I said, this time. Much, much better, but I won Michigan from her by 10,000 votes. I won Wisconsin by a small … I mean, they could have done that one and not get caught. We caught him, we caught him.
Donald Trump: (57:11)
And I say to people like Mike Lee, that here at Lindsey, I say, if they got approved and verified, they use the word verified, votes that are fraudulent. And then we find out after, because you can’t do it that quickly. It doesn’t go that quickly. It’s a lot of work and a lot of votes and a lot of people. And then we find out that they were frauds like in one state where you had, let’s say you lost by 25,000 votes. They verify it. And that’s supposed to be the end. But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your president? I don’t think it should. I don’t think it should. I don’t think that Kelly feels it should. I don’t think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots where illegally harvested. Can’t do that. Not allowed to.
Donald Trump: (58:09)
Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal unmanned drop boxes were put out statewide. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under Wisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally. By the way, I lost the … It was razor thin. There’s 170,000 votes. The margin in Wisconsin is only 20,000 votes. So this issue alone would have won that state for us many times over, we were leading at 10 o’clock in the evening by a lot. In Pennsylvania, there were 205,000 more ballots cast than there were voters. How do you get around that one?
Donald Trump: (58:58)
Which remains completely unexplained. You have great senators and representatives there and nobody can explain it, but think of that. And in other places too, you had more ballots than you had voters. You had more votes, think of it, then you had voters by a lot. In addition, Democrats, state Supreme court judges and Democrat secretary of state effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat controlled areas. And I say this because you can’t let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There’s an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can’t explain it. 400,000 previously unreported mail-in ballots, magically appeared. They couldn’t explain it. And all of a sudden they just happened to find 400,000. That’s a lot of people.
Donald Trump: (01:00:14)
Amazing. And the Pennsylvania legislature is not happy. Pennsylvania also had an estimated 8,000 dead voters, 55,000 ballots received back before they were even sent. How about that? The ballots were received, but they weren’t sent yet. Oh, get them out fast please. Many more with no mail date and 14,000 ballots illegally cast by out of state voters. Those are the numbers and those are the numbers we got from them. So they can’t say, Oh, the numbers aren’t so good. In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, we’re processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa clause, and it wouldn’t pick it up. Didn’t pick up anything. More than 42,000 people in Nevada double voted. That’s more than we needed, by far.
Donald Trump: (01:01:23)
In Arizona more than 36,000 votes were cast by non citizens. And there were 11,000 more ballots than there were voters. It seems to be a trait, doesn’t it? This was like at the Super Bowl, where you have 15 cameras and they’d say camera number four, you’re on. Camera number three, you’re on. In Michigan, according to one analyst, over 35,000 ballots listed no address, over 13 ballots were cast by non-residents and an estimated 17,000 ballots were cast by dead people. Some dead people, by the way, also requested an application through. Those are the ones that really bothered me. They not only vote, but they request an application. That’s a double. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting machines.
Donald Trump: (01:02:22)
And I want you to watch this very carefully tomorrow everybody, you have to watch it carefully. I want to read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. “Dear Mr president, as chairman of the Georgia Senate judiciary committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia.” You don’t hear this from your secretary of state and you don’t hear this from your governor and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you, but the governor won’t let him hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia’s 2020 general election.
Donald Trump: (01:03:26)
The committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, disgusted in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd 2020 general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don’t know where they come from. The committee then heard, and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives, the committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion’s voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing standout and require a forensic auditor of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted.
Donald Trump: (01:04:36)
The governor will not let us do it. We’ve been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election, he won’t let us do it. Why won’t he let us do it? There’s only one reason I can think of. First the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That’s the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voters intent. So they’re going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I think that voter meant something other. He doesn’t want Trump. Let’s just switch it around.
Donald Trump: (01:05:23)
Think of that. They’re trying to determine the voters intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up were designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody.
Donald Trump: (01:06:08)
Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a … I don’t say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. I don’t say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second and Biden came in way low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can’t get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn’t come in first. That’s why.
Donald Trump: (01:06:47)
Second, again from this very respected political leader, second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from president Trump to former vice president Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County, anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. President Trump was reported to a 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former vice-president Joe Biden was reported to have 17,000 to 18. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with president Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391. That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, during this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet. Now, anything connected to the internet, that’s not good, but this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they’re connected to the internet.
Donald Trump: (01:08:14)
Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time and in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former vice-president Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we’re talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable and immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion’s voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level …
Donald Trump: (01:09:03)
… Machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow’s race. You’ve got to be very careful. And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. “Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results.” “In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed, or tabulated in Maricopa County officials.” “Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony, for example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system.” Think of that. No, but think of this.
Donald Trump: (01:10:25)
Also, the press won’t report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don’t like this. They don’t like this. They don’t want to talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don’t like my phone call, everyone loved my phone call. They don’t like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%… Think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that’s a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And, nobody has a 100% voting.
Donald Trump: (01:11:21)
For all of these people who think it’s too late, does that mean that we’re forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities? I don’t think so. [crosstalk 01:11:32] I don’t think so. I want to thank those two great political leaders, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing. Hundreds of thousands of votes are missing. The only way to combat the Democrat fraud is to flood your polling places with a historic tidal wave of Republican voters tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (01:11:56)
Because at a certain point, the machines are going to explode. They almost did with me, unfortunately they didn’t quite get there, but we’ll figure that out. And, I just want Mike Lee to listen to this when I’m talking, because you know what? We need his vote. This election is your chance to stand up to the corrupt Democrat machine, and show them that the American people are still in charge.
Crowd: (01:12:20)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:12:23)
With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like this. Kelly, when did I say, we’ll do this, like two days ago, three days ago, right? And, look at this, and we love you all for being here, we really do. I’m glad the weathers good, we love you all. But, there’s never been a movement like this. I say it all the time, and the politicians, the lame stream medias, I call them affectionately, if that weren’t true they’d say, “That’s wrong, there’s never been a movement like this.” I mean, you have people that won one state, and they become world famous for the rest of their lives.
Donald Trump: (01:13:02)
You have people that came in second in New Hampshire and their [inaudible 00:04:06], we won everything and we won it now a second time. Hate to bore you with that expression. But, we won it now a second time. And, I don’t want to win it a third time, I really want to win it the second time, [inaudible 00:04:18]. Somebody came up to me today, Kelly, and they said, “Sir, you way up in four years, nobody can come close to me.” I said, “I’m not interested in four years, I’m interested in like eight weeks ago.”
Crowd: (01:13:34)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:13:35)
Four years is a long time. It’s actually two in two, we’ll take back the house for [crosstalk 01:13:42] Kevin and Marjorie. Jodi, we’ll bring back the house, right? We’ll bring back the house.
Crowd: (01:13:48)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years, four more years, four more years.
Donald Trump: (01:14:00)
No, we didn’t win, I’d be all upset. Of course, If I didn’t win, you probably wouldn’t want me, you know in all [inaudible 01:14:05].
Crowd: (01:14:05)
[crosstalk 01:14:06].
Donald Trump: (01:14:07)
A Big difference between losing and winning and having it stolen. No, but they talk about for years, sir, you haven’t made, nobody can come closer and I say, “Nope, we go this way first.” And, I think we’re going to do it. I really believe, because there’s no [crosstalk 01:14:23] way we could have won every single state, and for Fox, not one state, this is one of many. We win every state, and they’re going to have this guy be president and he can’t speak, he can’t talk. Already, we’ve achieved more than anyone thought possible. And, we are just getting started.
Speaker 1: (01:14:43)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:14:44)
And honestly, it’s you, it’s amazing what happened. I don’t even know why the hell I say let’s have a rally. We have a rally and thousands and thousands [inaudible 01:14:51] Honestly, I’ll go out on the extreme, there’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. And, the election is over, the presidential election, and we have a big one tomorrow, but there’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. Our economy is coming back. It’s roaring back. Our stock market is an all time high. Who would have thought that? We’re rounding the turn, because of what we did with the vaccines. And, nobody else would have done it, it would have taken so long. The economy boomed at 33. 4% last quarter, that’s the fastest rate ever recorded. And, we’re talking about [crosstalk 01:15:37] pandemic during a pandemic. We’ve already slashed the unemployment rate in half. And for decades, our politicians spend trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. You know, we’re bringing many of our great troops home. I mean, I hate to say it, but got to do it. We’ve been in Afghanistan for 19 years, I think that’s enough. I think that’s enough. We’ve got very few left and [crosstalk 01:16:09] very proud. Nothing worse than going to Dover and meeting the parents of our great warriors that have fallen, our great warriors coming home so badly wounded or dead. And, on countries that many of you have never even heard about. So, we bring our soldiers home. We’ve been incredible warriors, we can beat anybody. Nobody has our equipment, nobody has our military, nobody has our people-
Speaker 2: (01:16:36)
[inaudible 01:16:36].
Donald Trump: (01:16:37)
… but we aren’t over there to be policemen. We’re not over there to be policing, they’re warriors, they’re fighters, and that’s what we want them for. That’s what we have to have them for. But, we brought a lot of them home. We are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we’re bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back to the USA where they belong.
Donald Trump: (01:17:07)
But everything that we’ve achieved together is on the line tomorrow. Our fight to take back our country from the big donors, the big media and the horrendous big tech giant that our politicians, not these two politicians, are afraid to attack. Section 230, we have to get rid of Section 230 politiains-
Crowd: (01:17:26)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:17:30)
… or you’re not going to have a country very long, taken away all your rights. If you-
Speaker 3: (01:17:34)
[inaudible 01:17:34].
Donald Trump: (01:17:34)
… want to send a message to the powerful forces that are trying to control your country, you must get out and vote tomorrow for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.
Crowd: (01:17:47)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:17:47)
With your help, we’re going to continue our mission to save America, and we’re going to continue our mission of America first. It’s very simple.
Crowd: (01:17:59)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:18:01)
Each of us here tonight is United by the same core vision, and the same timeless American values. We love our country. Together, we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the center of American life.
Speaker 4: (01:18:15)
Yeah.
Speaker 5: (01:18:15)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:18:16)
We will defend the right to life, [crosstalk 01:18:19] religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, which they want to take away from you.
Crowd: (01:18:24)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:18:27)
And, we will always support the heroes of law enforcement.
Crowd: (01:18:34)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:18:35)
We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will preserve peace through strength.
Crowd: (01:18:44)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:18:44)
You know when I first got elected and before I got elected in 2015 and 2016, before they were in debates and everyone said, “Oh, he’s going to cause Wars, he’s going to cause wars.” I think I’m the only president in many, many decades that didn’t [crosstalk 01:19:00] get into a war, right.
Crowd: (01:19:01)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:19:01)
[inaudible 00:10:04]. Remember North Korea was going to be a tremendous nuclear fight, and all this, what happened with that? I got along very well with Kim Jong-un. I don’t think that Joe’s going to based on what I’ve heard, but I got along very well with him. And people say, “Whatever happened with North Korea, we got along well.” But, they all said that, “With my personality, I’ll be in a big war very soon within the first two weeks.” What happened? And, they don’t want to mess with us either, that [crosstalk 01:19:35] I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (01:19:36)
David and Kelly will protect Social Security and Medicare, and they will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.
Crowd: (01:19:50)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:19:54)
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag.
Crowd: (01:20:02)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:20:05)
And, we will live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, and it will stay that way.
Crowd: (01:20:13)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:20:16)
From Atlanta to Augusta, to Savannah, to Columbus, from Athens… And, I want to say hello to Herschel Walker, Athens.
Crowd: (01:20:26)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:20:26)
Herschel [crosstalk 01:20:28]. 10.2 yards of carry for a while, he made a lot of quarterbacks look very good. We love Hershel. To right here in Dalton, Georgia, we inherit the legacy of generations of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settle the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers that won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come.
Crowd: (01:21:16)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:21:22)
And, proud citizens like you helped build this country. And, together we are taking back our country, our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America’s destiny and dignity has only just begun. We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender.
Crowd: (01:21:49)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:21:54)
Because, we are Americans [crosstalk 01:21:56] and we are from Georgia-
Crowd: (01:22:00)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:22:00)
… and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
Crowd: (01:22:06)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:22:06)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And, together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market. We have made America strong again, look at that arm, look at…
Donald Trump: (01:22:35)
We have made America proud again, we’re proud of our country. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Go get him, David, go get him, Kelly, go get them tomorrow.

9,9,"



 
Mark Meadows: (00:00)
Mr. President, everyone is on the line. And just so this is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state, and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell, who is not the attorney of record but has been involved, myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I’ll turn it over to you.
President Trump: (00:38)
Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we’ve spent a lot of time on this and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it’s pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We’d be getting 25-30,000 people a rally and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense. But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3, anywhere from 250-300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn’t been checked. We think that if you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you’ll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that’s going to happen.
President Trump: (01:42)
Another tremendous number. We’re going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants, but an accurate number will be given. But it’s in the fifties of thousands and that’s people that went to vote and they were told they can’t vote because they’ve already been voted for. And it’s a very sad thing. They walked out complaining, but the number is large we’ll have it for you, but it’s much more than the number of 11,779. The current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That’s something, I think, at least that’s a number that everyone agrees on. But that’s the difference in the votes. But we had hundreds of thousands of ballots that were able to… Actually, we’ll get you a pretty accurate number.
President Trump: (02:43)
You don’t need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn’t vote, were told they couldn’t vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that’s very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it’s about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren’t on the voter registration list. So it’s 4,502 who voted but they weren’t on the voter registration roll which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant and they’re not allowed to be counted. That’s 18,325. A smaller number, you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O., A post office box number.
President Trump: (03:53)
And they had a post office box number and that’s not allowed. We had at least 18,000, that’s on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly. 18,000 voters having to do with Ruby Freeman. She’s a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler Ruby Freeman. That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else, where they got number one, they said very clearly. And it’s been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back Ruby Freeman and her daughter and a few people. There was no Republican poll Watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll Watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats either and there was no law enforcement.
President Trump: (04:55)
Early in the morning they went to the table with the black robe, the black shield and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before the table was put there. I think it was, Brad you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren’t in an official voter box, they were in what looked to be suitcases. But they weren’t in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion and it was magnified many times over and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden.
President Trump: (05:48)
You had out-of-state voters, they voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state of 4,925. You had absentee ballot sent to a vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses. That’s 2,326. And you had drop boxes, which is very bad. You had drop boxes that were picked up. We have photographs and we have affidavits from many people. I don’t know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box including, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by… We had vast, I mean, you have, the state is in turmoil over this, and I know you would like to get to the bottom of it.
President Trump: (07:01)
Although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, and I didn’t lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way… A lot of the political people said that there’s no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the… As you know, every single state… We won every state. We won every State House in the country. We held the Senate which is shocking to people, although we’ll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House. And we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there’s now a difference of five. That was supposed to be a different substantially more.
President Trump: (07:51)
But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that there was no way they’d beat me in the election that the people came out. In fact, they were expecting to lose. And then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said, there’s no way that they’ve done many polls prior to the election. There was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers and we’re trying to get to those numbers. And we will have them. They’ll take a period of time, certified. But they’re massive numbers and far greater than the 11,779. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted. And I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number. And a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is when you add it all up and then you start adding 300, 000 fake ballots.
President Trump: (09:04)
Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas, and this may or may not, because this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding ballots and removing equipment. They’re changing the equipment on the Dominion machines. And that’s not legal. And they supposedly shredded, I think they said 3000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it’s a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified or they will be certified. But they are certified. Those are numbers that are there that exist. And that beat the margin, the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot.
President Trump: (10:11)
And people should be happy to have an accurate count, instead of an election where there’s turmoil. I mean there’s turmoil in Georgia and other places. You’re not the only one. I mean, we have other States that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. But this is something that’s, as an example, I think in Detroit, and I think there’s a good section of your state actually, which we’re not sure, so we’re not going to report it yet. But in Detroit we had, I think it was 139% of the people voted. That’s not too good. And Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn’t play too well. And the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. But I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had, as an example of Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted, I think Mark it was 18,000.
President Trump: (11:22)
Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours. You were in the 4 to 5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers. So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line and provisional ballots, again, you’ll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. But we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren’t able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people. And they were shell shocked. I don’t know if you’d call that provisional ballots. In some States, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked into November 3rd, they were already voted for. So that’s it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win this State and we won the State and we won it very substantially and easily and we’re getting… We have… Much of this is they’re certified, far more certified that we need. But we’re getting additional number certified too. And we’re getting pictures of drop boxes being delivered and delivered late and delivered three days later in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.
Mark Meadows: (12:50)
So Mr. President, if I, I might be able to jump in and I’ll give Brad a chance, Mr. Secretary, obviously there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted. And that’s at odds with the representation from the secretary of state’s office. What I’m hopeful for is there some way that we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully. The president mentioned Fulton County, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. And so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise is there’s something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward, that’s less litigious?
Brad Raffensperger: (14:02)
Well, I listened to what the president has just said, President Trump, we’ve had several lawsuits and we’ve had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don’t agree that you have one. I didn’t agree about the 200,000 number that you’d mentioned, and I’ll go through that point by point. What we had done is we gave our State Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue. And then on the State House, the Government Affairs Committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our US congressmen, Republican congressmen. And we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you’ve talked about, you focused in on primarily, I believe it’s the absentee ballot process. I don’t believe that you’re really questioning the Dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100% re-tally of all the ballots and compare that to what the machine said. And it came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table. I don’t think there’s an issue about that. I think what you [crosstalk 00:15:33].
President Trump: (15:33)
Well, Brad. Not that there’s not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven’t felt we needed to go there. And just to maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we’d like to go further, but we don’t really need to. We have all the votes we need. We won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you.
President Trump: (16:03)
These are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. When you add them up, it’s many more times, it’s many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through … we have not gone through your Dominion, so we can’t give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we’ll have to see. But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have we’re giving you minimal numbers. We’re doing the most conservative numbers possible. We’re many times, many, many times above the margin. Mark, I don’t think we have to go through each-
Mark Meadows: (17:06)
Right, right.
President Trump: (17:06)
Because what’s the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. One of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina, and from other states, and they’re saying it’s impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won … in Alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it’s not possible to have lost Georgia. And I can tell you by our rallies, I can tell you by the rally I’m having on Monday night, the place they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It’s just not possible to have lost Georgia, it’s not possible.
President Trump: (17:54)
When I heard it was close, I said, “There’s no way.” But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night, you know that, Brad. And that’s what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified too. So I just don’t know, Mark, I don’t know what’s the purpose. I won’t give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don’t need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. I mean, having the correct … the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night, along with others that we’re going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even.
President Trump: (18:53)
And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that you’ve recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots, I mean, they’re all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, et cetera. And even if you cut them in half, cut them in half, and cut them in half again, it’s more votes than we need.
Brad Raffensperger: (19:23)
Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen and they were surprised. I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two, two. Two people that were dead that voted and so that’s wrong. That was two.
President Trump: (19:49)
Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? I mean, you tell me.
Cleta Mitchell: (19:54)
Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, and if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died. But we don’t have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary to confirm-
President Trump: (20:48)
[crosstalk 00:20:48] But Cleta, even before you do that and not even including that, that’s why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people so I don’t know. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. But is that we’re so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of Ruby Freeman, known scammer. You know the internet, you know what was trending on the internet? “Where’s Ruby?” Because they thought she’d be in jail. “Where’s Ruby?” It’s crazy, it’s crazy. The minimum number is 18,000 for Ruby, but they think it’s probably about 56,000. But the minimum number is 18,000 on the Ruby Freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let’s face it, Brad, I mean, they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.
President Trump: (21:55)
So there’s a term for it when it’s a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing, here’s ballot number, here it is a second time, third time, next ballot. I mean, look, Brad, we have a new tape that we’re going to release, it’s devastating. And by the way, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we’re talking about. That one event was a disaster. But it was something that … it can’t be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven’t seen, but it’s magnified. It’s magnified and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot and I don’t know why three times. Why not five times, right? Yeah, go ahead.
Brad Raffensperger: (22:59)
You’re talking about the State Farm video. And I think it’s extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. So the next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them see the full run of tape. And what you’ll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by-
President Trump: (23:24)
Where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there, there were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening, late in the early … in the morning. And there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watches? And why did they say a water main broke, which they did, and which is reported in the newspapers. They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break. And there was no water main, there was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where was the Democrat poll watchers? Because there were none. And then you say, “Well, they left their station.” If you look at the tape and this was reviewed by professional police and detectives, and other people. When they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station.
President Trump: (24:23)
When they came back, they didn’t go to their station. They went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those and they went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn’t do even that because that’s illegal, because they had no Republican poll watchers. And remember, her reputation is … she’s known all over the internet, Brad. She’s known all over. I’m telling you, “Where’s Ruby?” was one of the hot items on the … Ruby, they knew her. “Where’s Ruby?” So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was … and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? They put them in three times.
Brad Raffensperger: (25:28)
Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.
President Trump: (25:36)
Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Where were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room? How come we had no security in the room? Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad, and they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes. But they just all happened to run back and go … you know, Brad.
Brad Raffensperger: (26:11)
Mr. President, we’ll send you the link from WSB that does the-
President Trump: (26:14)
I don’t care about a link, I don’t need it. Brad, I have a much better link [crosstalk 00:26:18].
Cleta Mitchell: (26:14)
[crosstalk 00:26:14] Mr. Secretary, I will tell you, I’ve seen the tape, the full tape, so has Alex. We’ve watched it and what we saw, and what we’ve confirmed in the timing, is that they made everybody leave. We have sworn affidavits saying that and then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don’t know that. If you know that-
President Trump: (26:46)
It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times.
Cleta Mitchell: (26:52)
Well, I don’t know about that but I know-
President Trump: (26:52)
Well, I do because we had ours magnified out [crosstalk 00:26:57].
Cleta Mitchell: (26:55)
I’ve watched the entire tape.
President Trump: (27:01)
But nobody can make a case for that, Brad, nobody. I mean, look, you’d have to be a child to think anything other than that, just a child. I mean, you have you never-Trump [crosstalk 00:27:12] attorney-
Cleta Mitchell: (27:14)
How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then?
Brad Raffensperger: (27:22)
We had GPI certainly investigate that.
Ryan Germany: (27:22)
This is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them, as well as F.B.I. agents.
President Trump: (27:34)
Well, there’s no way they could … then they’re incompetent. They’re either dishonest or incompetent, okay [crosstalk 00:27:39].
Cleta Mitchell: (27:40)
Well, what did they find?
President Trump: (27:40)
There’s only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There’s just no way. Look, there’s no way. And on the other thing I said too, there’s no way that these things could have been … you have all these different people that voted, but they don’t live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too.
Cleta Mitchell: (28:01)
The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia. And so they had a date when they moved from Georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it’s like 4,500, I don’t have that number right in front of me.
President Trump: (28:15)
And then they came back in and they voted.
Cleta Mitchell: (28:18)
And voted, yeah.
President Trump: (28:19)
I thought that was a large number, though, it was in the 20s. And the point is-
Ryan Germany: (28:24)
We’ve been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they’re not accurate. Every one we’ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases-
President Trump: (28:43)
[crosstalk 00:28:43] Really, how may people do that? You mean they moved out, and then they said, “Ah, to hell with it, I’ll move back in.” It doesn’t sound like a very normal … you mean they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? Yeah, it’s crazy.
Ryan Germany: (28:57)
And this is, they moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there’s something about that data that it’s just not accurate.
President Trump: (29:06)
Well, I don’t know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia and they voted. It didn’t say they moved back in, Cleta, did it?
Cleta Mitchell: (29:16)
No, but I mean, we’re looking at the voter registrat- again, if you have additional records, we’ve been asking for that, but you haven’t shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you’ve investigated [crosstalk 00:29:29] the allegations.
President Trump: (29:29)
But Cleta, a lot of it you don’t need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election. I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There’s no way I lost Georgia. There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I’m just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they’re many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes. Now do you think it’s possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that’s what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because that’s illegal.
Ryan Germany: (30:15)
This is Ryan Germany, no, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County [crosstalk 00:30:21] We’re having an election on Tuesday.
President Trump: (30:24)
But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?
Ryan Germany: (30:31)
No.
President Trump: (30:31)
Are you sure, Ryan?
Ryan Germany: (30:34)
I’m sure, I’m sure, Mr. President.
President Trump: (30:39)
What about the ballots, the shredding of the ballots, have they been shredding ballots?
Ryan Germany: (30:44)
The only investigation that we have into that, they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from past elections.
President Trump: (31:00)
Well, I don’t know about that [crosstalk 00:31:02]. It doesn’t pass the smell test though, because we hear they’re shredding thousands and thousands of ballots. And now what they’re saying, “Oh, we’re just cleaning up the office.” I don’t think that-
Brad Raffensperger: (31:16)
Mr. President, the problem that you have with social media, people can say anything.
President Trump: (31:21)
Oh this isn’t social media. This is Trump media. It’s not social media. It’s really not, it’s not social media. I don’t care about social media. I couldn’t care less. Social media is Big Tech. Big Tech is on your side. I don’t even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. And you’re a Republican.
Brad Raffensperger: (31:42)
We believe that we do have an accurate election.
President Trump: (31:44)
No, no you don’t, no, no you don’t. You don’t have … not even close. You’re off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you’re off on these numbers, and these numbers can’t be just … Well, why won’t … okay, so you sent us into Cobb County for a signature verification-
President Trump: (32:03)
You sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn’t want to go into, and you said it would be open to the public, so we had our experts there. They weren’t allowed into the room. But we didn’t want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County, and you wouldn’t give it to us. Now, why aren’t we doing signature, and why can’t it be open to the public, and why can’t we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don’t want to find anything? You know they don’t want to find anything. Someday you’ll tell me the reason why, because I don’t understand your reasoning, but someday you’ll tell me the reason why. But why don’t you want to find?
Ryan Germany: (32:41)
Mr. President, we chose Cobb County-
President Trump: (32:41)
Why don’t you want to find … What?
Ryan Germany: (32:45)
Sorry, go ahead.
President Trump: (32:47)
Okay, so why did you do Cobb County? We didn’t even request … We requested Fulton County, not Cobb County.
Cleta Mitchell: (32:54)
Well, Mr. President, we do have in our election contest.
Ryan Germany: (32:55)
We chose Cobb County-
Cleta Mitchell: (32:57)
[inaudible 00:32:57].
President Trump: (32:57)
Go ahead, please. Go ahead.
Ryan Germany: (32:59)
We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there’s been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.
President Trump: (33:07)
No, but I told you, but we’re not saying that.
Cleta Mitchell: (33:10)
We did say that.
President Trump: (33:14)
Fulton County. Look, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can’t check signatures. I can’t imagine you’re allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step. I hate to imagine what’s going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it’s very scary to people. When the ballots flow in out of nowhere, it’s very scary to people. That consent decree is a disaster. It’s a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they’ve never seen anything like it.
Brad Raffensperger: (34:12)
Harvesting is still illegal in the state of Georgia, and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.
President Trump: (34:18)
It’s not a settlement agreement, it’s a consent decree. It even says consent decree on it, doesn’t it? It uses the term consent decree. It doesn’t say settlement agree. It’s a consent decree. It’s a disaster.
Brad Raffensperger: (34:32)
It’s a settlement agreement.
President Trump: (34:35)
What’s written on top of it?
Brad Raffensperger: (34:39)
Ryan?
Ryan Germany: (34:39)
I don’t have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court. It’s not a court order.
President Trump: (34:46)
But Ryan, it’s called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right?
Ryan Germany: (34:51)
I don’t believe so, but I don’t have it in front of me.
President Trump: (34:56)
Okay, whatever, it’s a disaster. It’s a disaster. Look, here’s the problem. We can go through signature verification and we’ll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past, but you didn’t do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever recently, and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago or even one, and you’ll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren’t even signed, and you have many that are forgeries, okay? You know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that, and you will be at 11,779 within minutes, because Fulton County is totally corrupt and so is she totally corrupt.
President Trump: (36:05)
And they’re going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad. Whether you know it or not, they’re laughing at you, and you’ve taken a state that’s a Republican state, and you’ve made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody’s ever cheated before. And I don’t care how long it takes me. We’re going to have other states coming forward pretty good, but I won’t … This is never … We have some incredible talent said they’ve never seen anything. Now, the problem is they need more time for the big numbers, but they’re very substantial numbers. But I think you’re going to find that …
President Trump: (36:50)
By the way, a little information. I think you’re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots, because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they’re brand new and they don’t have a seal and there’s the whole thing with the ballots, but the ballots are corrupt, and you are going to find that they are, which is totally illegal. It’s more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal offense, and you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard, and they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds, and you can’t let it happen and you are letting it happen. I mean, I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen.
President Trump: (37:48)
So look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state, and flipping the state is a great testament to our country because it’s a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it, if it was a mistake. I don’t know. A lot of people think it wasn’t a mistake. It was much more criminal than that, but it’s a big problem in Georgia and it’s not a problem that’s going away. I mean, it’s not a problem that’s going away.
Ryan Germany: (38:29)
Mr. President, this is Ryan. We’re looking into every one of those things that you mentioned. All investigators [crosstalk 00:38:36].
President Trump: (38:36)
Good, but if you find it you’ve got to say it, Ryan.
Ryan Germany: (38:41)
And they are.
President Trump: (38:42)
Let me ask you. Ryan, if they’re destroying ballots-
Ryan Germany: (38:42)
Let me tell you what we are seeing.
President Trump: (38:44)
Go ahead.
Ryan Germany: (38:45)
What we’re seeing is not at all what you’re describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they’re looking and they’re good, and that’s not what they’re seeing. And we’ll keep looking. We’ll keep looking at all these things. What we are seeing-
President Trump: (39:04)
Well, you better check the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I’m just telling you, Ryan. They’re shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully, because that’s so illegal. You may not even believe it because it’s so bad, but they’re shredding ballots because they think we’re going to eventually get there. Because we’ll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it’s never too late. So a little double sound there. So, that’s the story fellas. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We’ll have more and more. Do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots?
Brad Raffensperger: (39:59)
Provisional ballots are allowed by state law.
President Trump: (40:02)
Sure, but I mean, are they counted or did you just hold them back because? In other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?
Brad Raffensperger: (40:13)
We’ll get you that number.
President Trump: (40:14)
Because most of them are made out to the name, Trump, because these are people that were scammed when they came in, and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were probably going to vote on November 3rd, and they were told, “I’m sorry, you’ve already been voted for. You’ve already voted.” The women, men started screaming, “No, I proudly voted til November 3rd.” They said, “I’m sorry, but you’ve already been voted for, and you have a ballot,” and these people are beside themselves, so they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it.
President Trump: (40:55)
And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100% Trump. I mean, 100% Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in. I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100% for Biden, even though Trump won the military by a lot, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100% for Biden. Do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it?
Cleta Mitchell: (41:33)
I know about, but we were never-
Ryan Germany: (41:36)
[inaudible 00:41:36].
President Trump: (41:36)
Okay, Cleta. I’m not asking you Cleta, honestly. I’m asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now? Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100% for Biden. Do you know about that?
Ryan Germany: (41:56)
I don’t know about that. I do know that we have when military ballots come in, it’s not just military. It’s also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat.
President Trump: (42:15)
No, but this was-
Ryan Germany: (42:15)
This was a mix of them.
President Trump: (42:17)
That’s okay. But I got like 78% of the military. These ballots were all for … They didn’t tell me overseas. Could be overseas too, but I get votes overseas too, Ryan, in all fairness. No, they came in. A large batch came in and it was, quote, 100% for Biden, and that is criminal. That’s criminal, okay? That’s another criminal. That’s another of the many criminal events. Many criminal events here. I don’t know. Look, Brad, I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot, and therefore, I won the state. That’s before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. And I watched you this morning and you said, “Well, there was no criminality,” but all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it’s very dangerous for you to say that.
President Trump: (43:19)
I just don’t know why you don’t want to have the votes counted as they are. Like, even you, when you went and did that check, and I was surprised because, I didn’t [inaudible 00:43:30] the check, and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you’re doing is re-certifying existing votes. You were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. That was sort of surprising. That came down. Three or five. I don’t know, still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures, and if you check with Fulton County, you’ll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it.
President Trump: (44:10)
So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. We have that in spades already, or we can keep it going, but that’s not fair to the voters of Georgia because they’re going to see what happened, and they’re going to see what happened. I mean, I’ll take on to anybody you want with regard to Ruby Freeman and her lovely daughter. A very lovely young lady, I’m sure. But Ruby Freeman, I will take Freeman. I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots but they used them three times, so that’s a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way. That’s the other thing we didn’t say.
President Trump: (44:57)
The Ruby Freeman thing, the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important, do you know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad? Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan?
Ryan Germany: (45:22)
That’s not accurate, Mr. President.
President Trump: (45:24)
Huh. What is accurate?
Ryan Germany: (45:28)
The numbers that we are showing are accurate.
President Trump: (45:33)
No, about Ruby Freeman, about early in the morning, Ryan. When the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know who those ballots … Do who they were made out to? Do you know who they were voting for?
Ryan Germany: (45:52)
No, not specifically.
President Trump: (45:54)
Did you ever check?
Ryan Germany: (45:59)
We did what I described to you earlier.
President Trump: (46:02)
No, no, no. Did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by Ruby Freeman, a known political operative and balloteer. Did ever check who those votes were for?
Ryan Germany: (46:16)
We looked into that situation that you described.
President Trump: (46:19)
No, they were 100% for Biden. 100%. There wasn’t a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don’t you want to find this, Ryan? What’s wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I’m sure you’re a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. But I’m just curious, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn’t make sense. We’re way over the 17,779, right? We’re way over that number, and just if you took just Ruby Freeman, we’re over that number by five or six times when you multiply that times three, and every single ballot went to Biden. And you didn’t know that, but now you know it.
President Trump: (47:16)
So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it’s not fair to take it away from us like this, and it’s going to be very costly in many ways, and I think you have to say that you’re going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it. But reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don’t want to find answers. For instance, I’m hearing, Ryan, and he’s probably I’m sure a great lawyer and everything, but he’s making statements about those ballots that he doesn’t know. But he’s making them with such … He did make them with surety, but now I think he’s less sure, because the answer is they all went to Biden. That alone wins us the election by a lot.
President Trump: (48:03)
And that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know?
Brad Raffensperger: (48:07)
Mr. President, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information and then it comes before the court. And the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.
President Trump: (48:23)
Why do you say that though? I don’t know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts. But why do you say that? First of all, they don’t even assign us a judge. They don’t even assign us a judge. But why wouldn’t you… Hey Brad, why wouldn’t you want to check out Ruby Freeman? And why wouldn’t you want to say, “Hey, if in fact President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia”? Just that one incident alone, without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say you stick by… I mean, I’ve been watching you for… You don’t care about anything. Your numbers are right. But your numbers aren’t right. They’re really wrong, and they’re really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than ultimately… Look, ultimately, I win. Okay? Because-
Cleta Mitchell: (49:18)
But Mr. Secretary, Mr. President-
President Trump: (49:18)
You guys are so wrong and you’ve created the population of Georgia so badly between you and your governor who was down at 21… He was down 21 points and like a schmuck, I endorsed him and he got elected. But I will tell you, he’s a disaster. I can’t imagine… The people are so angry in Georgia. I can’t imagine he’s ever getting elected again. I’ll tell you that much right now. But why wouldn’t you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? Because those numbers are so wrong. [crosstalk 00:50:00].
Cleta Mitchell: (49:59)
Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been… Alex can talk about this. We talked about it. And I don’t know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, what we’ve been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven’t even assigned a judge, but the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. You have data and records that we don’t have access to, and you keep telling us and making public statements that you’ve investigated this and nothing to see here. But we don’t know about that. All we know is what you tell us. What I don’t understand is why wouldn’t it be in everyone’s best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers.
Cleta Mitchell: (50:56)
But to try to be able to get to the truth because we don’t have any way of confirming what you’re telling us. You tell us that you’ve had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don’t have any report. I’ve never seen a report of investigation. I don’t know what that is. I’ve been pretty involved in this. I don’t know. That’s just one of 25 categories and it doesn’t even… As the president said, we haven’t even gotten into the Dominion issue. That’s not part of our case. It’s not part of… We just didn’t feel as though we had any way to be able to develop [crosstalk 00:03:42]-
President Trump: (51:40)
No, we do have a way, but I don’t want to get into it-
Cleta Mitchell: (51:43)
Exactly.
President Trump: (51:43)
Because we found a way in other states, Cleta. Excuse me.
Cleta Mitchell: (51:46)
Right.
President Trump: (51:47)
But we don’t need it because we’re only down 11,000 votes. So we don’t even need it.
Cleta Mitchell: (51:52)
Right. All I’m saying [crosstalk 00:51:53]-
President Trump: (51:52)
I personally think they’re corrupt as hell, but we don’t need that-
Cleta Mitchell: (51:56)
[crosstalk 00:51:57]-
President Trump: (51:57)
Because all we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000 plus votes. So we don’t need that. I’m not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic simple numbers, we want it easily. Easily. We’re not giving Dominion a pass, on the record. I will say that.
Cleta Mitchell: (52:20)
No. Right. Exactly.
President Trump: (52:22)
We don’t need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don’t need to prove it anymore than we already have.
Kurt Hilbert: (52:30)
Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert. If I might interject here for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that to just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 folks that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or replace the outcome in doubt. We would like to just sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and settlement just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. If you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We’ve had now three to four separate experts look at these numbers. These numbers are based upon the USPS-
President Trump: (53:19)
And certified accountants looked at them.
Kurt Hilbert: (53:22)
Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own Secretary of State data. So that’s what we would [inaudible 00:53:30] and ask you to do to sit down with us in a compromise and settlement proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. If you can convince us that that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that that is obviously more than 11,779 that’s sufficient to change the result entirely in and of itself. What would you say to that, Mr. Germany?
Ryan Germany: (54:03)
Kurt, I’m happy to… I’ll get with our lawyers and we’ll set that up. But that number is not accurate, and I think we can show you for all the ones we’ve looked at why it’s not. So if that would be helpful, I’m happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.
President Trump: (54:22)
Well, let me ask you, Kurt. Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the Secretary of State’s department, right?
Kurt Hilbert: (54:31)
That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the Secretary of State’s office data. That has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the Secretary of State. Yet, we have asked for it six times. I’ve sent a letter over to Mr. [inaudible 00:54:50] several times requesting this information, and it’s been rebuffed every single time. It stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there’s something to hide. That’s the problem that we have.
Ryan Germany: (55:04)
Well, that’s not the case. There are things that you guys are entitled to get and there’s things that under law, we are not allowed to give out.
President Trump: (55:11)
Well, you have to… Well, under law you’re not allowed to give faulty election results. Okay? You’re not allowed to do that. And that’s what you’ve done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up. Because of what you’ve done to the president… The people of Georgia know that this was a scam. Because of what you’ve done to the president, a lot of people aren’t going out to vote, and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it, and they’re going to vote. And you would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And therefore, I think that it really is important that you have meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers.
President Trump: (56:01)
Because I know, Brad, if you think we’re right, I think you’re going to say… And I’m not looking to blame anybody. I’m not blaming. I’m just saying that under new counts and under new views of the election results, we won the election. It’s very simple. We won the election. As the governor of major states and the surrounding states, there’s no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody, everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I’ll tell you it’s going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don’t get this thing straightened out fast.
Mark Meadows: (56:45)
Mr. President, this is Mark. Let me just… It sounds like we’ve got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas. I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the Secretary of State’s data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct?
Ryan Germany: (57:15)
That’s not what I said. I’m happy to sit down or have our lawyer sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, “Hey, based on what we’ve looked at so far, here’s how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.” [crosstalk 00:57:32]
Mark Meadows: (57:32)
What you’re saying, Ryan… Hold on. Let me make sure. So what you’re saying is you really don’t want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?
Ryan Germany: (57:44)
I don’t think we can give access to data that’s protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say, “Hey, we’re looking [crosstalk 00:57:52]-”
President Trump: (57:51)
But you’re allowed to have a phony election? You’re allowed to have a phony election, right?
Ryan Germany: (57:56)
No, sir.
President Trump: (57:58)
When are you going to do the signature counts on… When are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County? Which you said you were going to do and now all of a sudden you’re not doing it. When are you doing that?
Ryan Germany: (58:10)
We are going to do that. We’ve announced it.
Kurt Hilbert: (58:12)
To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the Secretary of State could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that private information without you having any kind of violation?
President Trump: (58:29)
Well, I don’t want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That’s okay. I don’t need to know names.
Mark Meadows: (58:38)
All right. Let me-
President Trump: (58:39)
But we got the information on this stuff that we’re talking about. We got all that information from the Secretary of State.
Mark Meadows: (58:48)
Yeah. So let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together when we get off of this phone call. If you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we’ve got with your attorneys where we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, you said there was only two dead people that would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. That may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there were more than that. But at the same time, I think it’s important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that’s the good next step, hopefully we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.
President Trump: (59:43)
Well, why don’t my lawyers show you where you got the information? It’ll show the Secretary of State. And you don’t even have to look at any names. We don’t want names. We don’t care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about… She’s going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she’s done to this party is unbelievable. I tell you. And I only ran against her once, and that was with a guy named Brian Kemp. And I beat her. If I didn’t run, Brian wouldn’t have had even a shot either in the general or the primary. He was dead. Dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was, but that’s the way it is. That’s the way it is.
President Trump: (01:00:29)
I would like you to… For the attorneys [inaudible 00:12:31], I’d like you to perhaps meet with Ryan ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you’re going to have people just not voting. They don’t want to vote. They hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the Secretary of State. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you. They like you. They can’t believe what they found. They want more people like you.
President Trump: (01:01:04)
Look, can you get together tomorrow? Brad, we just want the truth. It’s simple. And everyone’s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It’s okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. The real truth is I won by 400,000 votes at least. That’s the real truth, but we don’t need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. Are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan?
Ryan Germany: (01:01:38)
I’ll get with Chris, the lawyer who’s representing us in the case and see when he can get together with Kurt.
Kurt Hilbert: (01:01:45)
All right.
Brad Raffensperger: (01:01:46)
Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call. Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time.
President Trump: (01:01:53)
Okay. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
Mark Meadows: (01:01:58)
Thank you.
Cleta Mitchell: (01:01:58)
Thank you.
President Trump: (01:01:58)
Thank you very much. Bye. [crosstalk 01:02:01].

Melania Trump: (00:00)
The president and I want to wish every American a very Merry Christmas.
Donald Trump: (00:05)
During the sacred season, Christians celebrate the greatest miracle in human history. More than 2,000 years ago, God sent his only begotten son to be with us. An angel announced the birth of our lord and savior to humble shepherds. He said, “I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all of the people. Today in the town of David, a savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger.” At Christmas, we thank God for sending us his son to bring peace to our souls and joy to the world.
Melania Trump: (00:48)
As you know, this Christmas is different than years past. We are battling a global pandemic that has affected all of us. Yet, through this great challenge, we have been inspired by the kindness and courage of citizens across this country. Teachers have worked extraordinarily hard to keep our children learning. Students have delivered groceries to elderly neighbors. Communities have found new ways to stay connected to one another. Courageous first responders, doctors, and nurses have given everything to save lives. Brilliant scientists have developed treatments and vaccines.
Donald Trump: (01:34)
We are delivering millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine that will soon end this terrible pandemic and save millions and millions of lives. We’re grateful for all of the scientists, researchers, manufacturing workers, and service members who have worked tirelessly to make this breakthrough possible. It is truly a Christmas miracle.
Melania Trump: (01:59)
During this wonderful time of year, we also give thanks for the brave and selfless Americans who keep us safe. We are forever grateful for the men and women of law enforcement and the heroes of the United States military.
Donald Trump: (02:17)
In this holy season, we thank God for his infinite love and we pray that the light of his glory will forever shine on this magnificent land. On behalf of Melania and the entire Trump family, we wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Donald Trump: (00:00)
Throughout the summer, Democrats cruelly blocked COVID relief legislation in an effort to advance their extreme left wing agenda and influence the election. Then a few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It’s taken forever. However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (00:31)
For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity, it’s called the COVID Relief Bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID. This bill contains $85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia, $134 million to Burma, $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan, $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. $40 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, which is not even open for business. $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art. Likewise, these facilities are essentially not open.
Donald Trump: (01:43)
$7 million for reef fish management, $25 billion to combat Asian carp, $2.5 million to count the number of amberjack fish in the Gulf of Mexico. A provision to promote the breeding of fish in federal hatcheries, $3 million in poultry production technology, $2 million to research the impact of down trees, $566 million for construction projects at the FBI.
Donald Trump: (02:17)
The bill also allows stimulus checks for the family members of illegal aliens, allowing them to get up to $1,800 each. This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending and much more, the $900 billion package provides hardworking taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments and not enough money is given to small businesses. And in particular, restaurants, whose owners have suffered so grievously. They were only given a deduction for others to use in business, their restaurant, for two years. This two year period must be withdrawn, which will allow the owners to obtain financing and get their restaurants back in condition. Congress can terminate it at a much later date, but two years is not acceptable. It’s not enough.
Donald Trump: (03:18)
Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn’t their fault, it was China’s fault. Not their fault. I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. I’m also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package, and maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done. Thank you very much.
